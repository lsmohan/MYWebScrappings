Let us glorify śrīla Vyāsadeva, the spiritual master of the great sages, the literary incarnation of Lord
Nārāyaṇa and the son of Satyavatī. Let us surrender to Vaiśampāyana Muni, the speaker of the Mahābhārata
who became jubilant by drinking the nectar of Lord Viṣṇu's thousand names. Let us bow down before Kṛṣṇa's
friend Bhīṣma, the best of the wise and the son of Gaṅgā-devī, and let us also bown down before the saintly
devotees who relish the narrations of Lord Viṣṇu's glories.

We offer respectful obeisances to those great devotees who are completely devoted to chanting the holy
names of Lord Hari. It is by their mercy that I am able to write this Nāmārtha-sudhā-bhāṣya (commentary on
the Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma, entitled "The Nectar of the Meaning of Lord Hari's Holy Names").

Bhīśma said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the controller of all moving and non-moving beings
within the universe, and He is the worshipable master of all the demigods. His transcendental forms and
qualities are all unlimited, and He is the best of persons. One should always enthusiastically glorify Him by
chanting the Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma (Thousand names of Lord Viṣṇu).

With great faith, the devotee should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa, whose
forms, qualities, opulences and pastimes are all eternal and transcendental. The devotee should glorify Him,
continually meditate on His transcendental form, and offer obeisances by bowing down before Him.

anādi-nidhanaṃ viṣṇuṃ
sarva-loka-maheśvaram
lokādhyākṣam stuvan nityaṃ
sarva-duḥkātigo bhavet

There was never a time when Lord Viṣṇu first came into existance, and there is no time in the future when
He will cease to exist. He is the supreme master of all planets, all living entities, and all the demigods who
control the universe. He is the all-pervading, all-knowing witness who sees everything. A person who regularly
glorifies Him becomes free from all material miseries, and in that liberated condition becomes full of
transcendental bliss.

Note: In his commentary, śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following verses to describe the
immense potency of the glorification of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

sakṛd uccāritaṃ yena
harir ity akṣaraṃ dvayam
baddhaḥ parikaras tena
mokṣāya gamanaṃ prati

"If one chants the two syllables Ha-ri, even once, he becomes free from all material bondage."

sakṛd eva parigītaṃ
sṛaddhayā helayā vā
bhṛguvara nara-mātraṃ
tārayet kṛṣṇa-nāma

"O best of the Bhṛgu dynasty, if one even once speaks the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, either with faith, or
even casually, or with contempt, the holy name will liberate that chanter from all material bondage."

brahmaṇyaṃ sarva-dharmajñaṃ
lokānāṃ kīrti-vardhanam
loka-nāthaṃ mahad-bhūtam
sarva-bhūta-bhavodbhavam

Lord Viṣṇu is the protector and well-wisher of the brāhmaṇas, aware of all principles of religion, the Lord
who expands the glory of His devotees, the supreme monarch of all planetary systems, full of all opulences,
and the original father of Brahmā, śiva and all living entities.

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following verses from Mahābhārata, where Kṛṣṇa explains
that He is the source of all living beings.

prajāpatiṃ ca rudraṃ cāpy
aham eva sṛjāmi vai
tau hi māṃ na vijānīto
mama māyā-vimohitau

"The patriarchs, śiva and others are created by Me, though they do not know that are created by Me,
because they are deluded by My illusory energy."*

eśa me sarva-dharmānāṃ

stavair arcan naraḥ sadā

I think that the best of all spiritual activites is tocontinuously and devotedly worship lotus-eyed Lord Kṛṣṇa
by reciting prayers glorifying Him and describing His holy names.

Note: In his commentary, śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following verses from the Vedic
literatures to describe the glories of the chanting of Lord Kṛṣṇa's holy names.

The śruti-mantra explains:

asya jānanto nāma cid-vivaktana-mahas te viṣṇo sumatim bhajāmahe oṃ tat sat

"O Lord Viṣṇu, we worship You, and we are fully conscious of the spiritual nature of Your holy names."

The Padma Purāṇa explains:

nāma cintāmahiḥ kṛṣṇaś

caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ
pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto

'bhinnatvaṃ māma-māminoḥ

"The holy name of Kṛṣṇa is transcendentally blissful. It bestows all spiritual benedictions, for it is Kṛṣṇa
Himself, the reservoir of all pleasrue. Kṛṣṇa's name is complete, and it is the form of all transcendental
mellows. It is not a material name under any condition, and it is no less powerful than Kṛṣṇa Himself. Since
Kṛṣṇa's name is not contaminated by the material qualities, there is no question of it being involved with
māyā. Kṛṣṇa's name is always liberated and spiritual; it is never conditioned by the laws of material nature.
This is because the name of Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa Himself are identical."*

paramaṃ yo mahat-tejaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is supremely powerful and splendid, and it is from
Him that the sun and other luminaries derive their splendor and heat. He is the ultimate shelter of all living
entities. He is partially manifested as the Brahman effulgence.

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa comments that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the
demigods are all His order-carriers. In this connection, He quotes the following verse from the smṛti-śāstra.

yad-bhīṣā vātaḥ pavate bhīṣodeti sūryaḥ
bhīṣāsmād agniś candraś ca mṛtyur dhāvati

"Out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the wind blows, and out of fear of Him the sun rises.
Out of fear of Him fire, the moon, and death, all perform their respective duties."

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the most purifying of all purifiers, and it is He who gives the power to remove sinful reactions
to the Ganges and other places of pilgrimage. He is the most auspicious of all auspicious personalities, and it is
He who gives to Gaṇeśa and others the power to remove obstacles. He is the most worshipable person,
superior to Brahmā and all the demigods. He is the eternal, original father of all living entities.

All living beings come from Lord Kṛṣṇa at the beginning of creation. They are maintained by Lord Kṛṣṇa
while the creation is manifested, and they enter into Him again when the creation is destroyed.

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa notes that the the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the source of the
entire creation. He quotes the authoritative statement of Vedānta-sūtra (1.1.2) janmādy asya yataḥ (The
Absolute Truth is He from whom everything emanates).

Please hear from me the one-thousand holy names of Lord Viṣṇu, the supreme master and controller of the
universe. These holy names of the Lord destroy the fearful reactions of past sinful deeds.

Text 13

yāni nāmāni gauṇāni
vikhyātāni mahātmanaḥ
ṛśibhiḥ parigītāni
tāni vakṣyāmi bhūtaye

In order to attain the supreme goal of life, I shall now chant the celebrated holy names of Lord Viṣṇu.
Great sages glorify these holy names, which describe the Lord's transcendental qualities and pastimes.

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa notes that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
although He appears in a multitude of forms, just as the vaidurya stone remains a single jem, although it
appears to change colors. The Gopāla Tāpanī Upaniṣad explains:

eko vaśī sarvagaḥ kṛṣṇa īḍya
eko 'pi san bahudhā yo 'vabhāti

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the omnipotent, all-pervading worshipable Personality of Godhead. Although He is one, He
has manifested in many forms."

The śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (1.3.28) also explains:

kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam

"All of the above mentioned incarnations are either plenary portions, or portions of the plenary portions of
the Lord, but Lord śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead."*

śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣana says: Manifesting in innumerable forms, the Lord sometimes displays all His
potencies, and sometimes He displays only a part of His potencies. Appearing as Lord Nārāyaṇa, He displays
all His potencies. Appearing in His kalā (partial) expansions, He reveals only part of His potency. He appears
as Lord Vāsudeva, who has no contact with the material world, and again He appears as Saṅkarṣaṇa,
Pradyumna and Aniruddha. He appears as Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Garbhodadaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī
Viṣṇu, who are completely spiritual manifestations free from any trace of matter, and who are known as the
puruṣa-avatāras. From Lord Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu Lord Kūrma and the other līlā-avatāras (pastime
incarnations), as well as the manvantara-avatāras (incarnations during the period of Manu) and Yuga-avatāra
(incarnations for the millenium) appear. All these incarnations are glorified in the verses of the Purāṇas.

Conscious that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the original form from whom the other forms of the Personality of Godhead
emanate, Bhīśma now describes the holy names that describe Lord Kṛṣṇa's various forms and pastimes.

oṃ viśvaṃ viṣṇur vaśatkāro
bhūta-bhavya-bhavat-prabhuḥ
bhūta-kṛd bhūta-bhṛd bhāvo
bhūtātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ

Let me offer my respectful obeisances to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who pervades the entire
universe (viṣṇu). He is worshiped in the Vedic sacrifices (vaśatkāra). He is eternally the Supreme Controller,
in all phases of time, including past, present and future (bhūta-bhavya-bhavat-prabhu). He is the creator of the
cosmic manifestation (bhūta-kṛt) and He maintains it as well (bhūta-bhṛt). He is the master of all spiritual and
material potencies (bhāva). He is the creator of all living entities (bhūtātmā) and the well-wisher who
promotes their welfare (bhūta-bhāvana).

Note: In his commentary, śīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the description of creation found in the
Upaniṣads:

so 'kāmayata bahu syāṃ prajāyeya

"Supreme Personality desired: Let me become many. I will manifest the entire creation by My potencies."

pūtāmā paramātmā ca
muktānāṃ paramā gatiḥ
avyayaḥ puruṣaḥ sākṣī

Lord Kṛṣṇa is supremely pure (pūtātmā) and He is the Supreme Soul (paratmātmā). He is the ultimate goal
and destination of the liberated souls (muktānāṃ paramā gatiḥ). and He is the eternal (avyaya) Supreme
Person (puruṣa). He is the witness of everything (sākṣī) and He knows what happens to all living entities
(kṣetrajña). He is infallible (akṣara).

Note: In his commentary, śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa notes that although Lord Kṛṣṇa is the creator of the
cosmic manifestation, He remains aloof from it. For this reason He remains always free from material
contamination, and He is the supreme pure.

yogo yoga-vidāṃ netā
pradhāna-puruṣeśvaraḥ
narasiṃha-vapuḥ śrīmān
keśavaḥ puruṣottamaḥ

He is the auspicious reservoir of yogic perfection, and success in yoga practice depends upon Him (yoga).
He is the leader of those advanced in yoga (yoga-vidāṃ netā), and He is the supreme controller of the material
universe and all living entities (pradhāna-puruṣeśvara). Even though He has appeared in a half-man, half-lion
incarnation (narasiṃha-vapuḥ), He is extremely handsome (śrīmān). He is the father of Brahmā and śiva
(Keśava), and He is the supreme Person (puruṣottama).

Note: In his commentary, śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes Lord śiva's explanation of the name
Keśava:

ka iti brahmāṇo nāma
īśo 'ham sarva-dehinām
āvāṃ tavāṅga-saṃbhūtau
tasmāt keśava-nāma-bhāk

"Ka is a name of Brahmā, and I (śiva) am known as īśa, because I am the master of all living entities who
reside in material bodies. O Lord Kṛṣṇa, because we are born from your body, you are therefore known as
Keśava (the father of Brahmā and śiva)."

Lord Kṛṣṇa is known as Puruṣottama because He is the best of all persons including both conditioned and
liberated souls. The Lord Himself has explained the meaning of this name in the Bhagavad-gītā (15.18):

yasmāt kṣaram atīto 'ham
akṣarād api cottamaḥ
ato 'smi loke vede ca
prathitaḥ puruṣottamaḥ

"Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I
am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as that Supreme Person."*

Text 17

sarvaḥ śarvah śivaḥ sthānur
bhūtādir nidhir avyayaḥ
saṃbhavo bhāvano bhartā
prabhavaḥ prabhur īśvaraḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa is present everywhere, and therefore He is everything (sarva). He is supremely benefical
(śarva) and He is the most auspicious (śiva). He is always very merciful (sthānu) and He is the creator of all
living entities (bhūtādi). He gives happiness to all (nidhi) and He is imperishable (avyaya). He always thinks
how to protect the devotees (bhāvana) and He descends to the material world in order to protect them
(saṃbhava). He is the maintainer of the devotees (bhartā) and He is the origin of everything (prabhava). He is
the supreme master who can perform any feat impossible to be performed by Brahmā or anyone else
(prabhu), and He is the supreme controller of all living entities (īśvara).

Note: In his commentary, śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes Arjuna's explanation of how Kṛṣṇa is
everything (Bhagavad-gītā 11.40):

sarvaṃ samāpnośi tato 'si sarvam

"O Kṛṣṇa, You are all-pervading, and thus You are everything."*

Lord Kṛṣṇa's appearance within this material world to protect the devotees is explained by the Lord
Himself in the Bhagavad-gītā (4.8):

paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṃ
vināśāya ca duśkṛtām
dharma-saṃsthāpanārthāya
saṃbhavāmi yuge yuge

"In order to deliver the pious and annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of
religion, I advent Myself millenium after millenium."*

The Lord's killing of Hiraṇyakaśipu and protection of the Pāṇḍavas by different tactics may be cited as
examples of these purposes of the Lord.

svayambhūḥ śambhur ādityaḥ
puṣkarākṣo mahāsvanaḥ
anādi-nidhano dhātā
vidhātā dhatur uttamaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the self-sufficient Lord (svayambhū) whose auspicious transcendental qualities bring great
happiness to the devotees (śambhu). Among the demigods He appears in a splendid golden form (āditya) and
He is all-pervading (puṣkarākṣa). He is the supreme object of worship (mahāsvana) and He was never born
and will never die (anādi-nidhana). He is the original creator, before Brahmā or anyone else (dhātā) and He is
the original author of all Vedic injunctions (vidhātā). He is the Supreme Person (dhatur uttama).

Note: Kṛṣṇa's self-sufficiency is described in Iṣa Upaniṣad (mantra 8):
kavir manīśi paribhuḥ svayambhūḥ
"The Supreme Person is the self-sufficient philosopher who is omniscient and the greatest of all."*

The all-pervasiveness of the Lord is explained in the śruti-śāstra: "akāśātmā (the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is all-pervading)".

śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa presents the following quotes from the śruti, where Kṛṣṇa's authorship of
them is explained:

tasya vā etasya mahato bhūtasya niśvāsitam etad yad ṛg-vedo yajur-vedaḥ

"The ṛg-veda and Yajur-veda are produced from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."*
yo brahmāṇaṃ vidadhāti pūrvaṃ yo vidyās tasmai jñāpayati sa kṛṣṇaḥ

"It was Kṛṣṇa who in the beginning instructed Brahmā in Vedic knowledge and who disseminated Vedic
knowledge in the past."*

In the Bhagavad-gītā (14.3), Kṛṣṇa Himself explains that He is the original creator of all living entities:

mama yonir mahad brahma

tasmin garbhaṃ dadhāmy aham
sambhavaḥ sarva-bhūtānāṃ

tato bhavati bhārata

"The total material substance, called brahman, is the source of birth, and it is that brahman that I
impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings, O son of Bharata."*

aprameyo hṛṣīkeśaḥ
padma-nābho 'mara-prabhuḥ
viśva-karmā manus tvaṣṭā
sthaviṣṭhaḥ sthaviro dhruvaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa is unlimited and cannot be measured by the finite senses of Brahmā and the other demigods
(aprameya), and He is the master of the senses (Hṛṣīkeśa). Lord Brahmā took birth from His lotus-navel
(padma-nābha) and He is the master of the demigods (amara-prabhu) who gives them jurisdiction in the
affairs of creation and maintenance of the material universe. Seated within the hearts of Brahmā and the other
demigods, He gives them the ability to create and maintain the universe (viśva-karmā). He knows everything
(manu) and His form is very handsome and splendid (tvaṣṭā). He creates innumerable universes by His
inconceivable potency (sthaviṣṭha) and He is eternal (sthavīra and dhruva).

Note: That Lord Kṛṣṇa is unlimited and immeasurable is explained in the following statement of Lord
Brahmā:

na hy ādi-madhyāntam ajasya yasya
vidmo vayaṃ sarvamayasya dhātuḥ

"Neither I, nor any other demigod can understand the beginning middle or end of the unborn, all-pervading
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the creator of everything."

The handsomeness of Lord Kṛṣṇa is described in the following quote from the śruti-śāstra:

sarvāṇi rūpāṇi vicitya dhīro
nāmāni kṛtvābhivādan yad aste

"The saintly devotees meditate on the handsomeness of the forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
and chant His holy names."

That Lord Kṛṣṇa is the source from whom the universe has emanated is confirmed in the Smṛti-śas_tra:

nistaraḥ sarva-bhūtasya
viṣṇor viśvam idaṃ jagat

"From Lord Viṣṇu the entire universe and all living entities have emanated."

The inconceivable potencies of the Lord are described in the śvetāśvatara Upaniśad (6.8):

parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate
svabhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead has such potencies that anything He wants done will be done
perfectly well through the control of material nature."*

It is further explained:

pradhāna-kṣetrajña-patir guṇeśaḥ

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the controller of the material manifestation and the living entities.
He is the master of the modes of nature."

agrāhyaḥ śāśvataḥ kṛṣṇo
lohitākṣaḥ pratardanaḥ
prabhūtas trikakud dhāma
pavitraṃ maṅgalaṃ param

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the non-material cause of the material manifestation (agrāhya),
and He is eternal (śāśvata). He has an eternal, all-attractive form (kṛṣṇa), and His handsome eyes are reddish
(lohitākṣa). He removes the distresses in the hearts of His devotees (pratardana), and He is the supreme
monarch (prabhūta). He resides in the spiritual world, which is three fouths of the entire existance (trikakuddhāma).
He is the supreme pure, free from all material contamination, and He is the supreme purifier
(pavitram). He is the supreme auspiciousness (maṅgalam param).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa notes that the most important form of the Supreme is the form of
Kṛṣṇa. This form is a completely spiritual and it is full of spiritual bliss. This form is extremely handsome, and
is compared to the exquisite atasi flower. The etymological derivation of the name Kṛṣṇa is found in the
Mahābhārata (Udyoga-parva 71.4):

kṛśir bhu-vācakaḥ śabdo

ṇaś ca nirvṛti-vacakaḥ
tayor aikyaṃ paraṃ brahma

kṛṣṇa ity abhidhīyate

"The word "kṛṣ"is the attractive feature of the Lord's
existance, and "na"means spiritual pleasure. When the verb "kṛś"is added to affix "na", it becomes Kṛṣṇa,
which indicates the Absolute Truth."*

Of all the names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa is the most important, as the Lord Himself
has confirmed:

nāmnāṃ mukhyatamaṃ nāma
kṛṣṇākhyaṃ me parantapa

"My dear Arjuna, 'Kṛṣṇa' is the most important of all My names."

The Lord's handsome eyes are reddish. This is described in the śruti:

samāvṛṣo lohitākṣaḥ

"The Supreme Lord has a complexion like a dark monsoon cloud and His eyes are reddish."

The handsome eyes of the Lord are also described in the Smṛti:

mada-vighūrṇita-locana iṣan mānadaḥ sav-suhṛdāṃ vana-mālī

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead wears an exquisite garland of forest flowers, and His eyes move as
if He were intoxicated. He is very kind and affectionate to His friends and He is fond of praising them."

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the supreme auspiciousness. This is confirmed in the Smṛti-śāstra:

"Simply by rembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead all inauspiciousness is driven away, and
auspiciousness becomes very prominent. For this reason, the Personality of Godhead is known as the supreme
auspiciousness."

The Smṛti-śāstra again confirms this point:

"I offer my respectful obeisances to the Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme auspiciousness"

īśānaḥ prāṇadaḥ prāṇo
jyeṣṭhaḥ śreṣṭhaḥ prajāpatiḥ
hiraṇyagarbho bhūgarbho
mādhavo madhusūdanaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the creator of everything (īśāna), and in His form as the first puruṣa-avatāra, Kāraṇodakaśāyī
Viṣṇu, He gives life and the functions of the mind and senses to the living entities (prāṇada). As the second
puruṣa-avatāra, He is the life-force, which maintains the living entities (prāṇa). He is the oldest person
(jyeṣṭha), and He is the best person, full of excellent transcendental qualities (śreṣṭha). He is the master of
Garuḍa and other eternally liberated souls (prajāpati), and His spiritual realm is as splendid as gold
(hiraṇyagarbha). He is the maintainer of the earth planet (bhūgarbha) and the husband of the goddess of
fortune, Lakṣmī-devī (mādhava). Rememberance of Him puts an end to the repetition of birth and death in
this material world (madhusūdana).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa gives the following explanation of the word prāṇada (giver of life, mind
and senses to the living entities):

buddhīndriya-manaḥ-prāṇāṇ
janānām asṛjat prabhuḥ

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead created the intelligence, mind, senses, and life-force of the many
living entities."

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the master of all living entities. This is described in the śruti:

tad akṣare parame prajāḥ

"The imperishable Personality of Godhead is the supreme master and father of all living entities."

The Lord's spiritual realm is as splendid as gold. This is confirmed in the śruti-śāstra:
hiraṇmaye pure kośe

virajaṃ brahma niṣkalam

"The supremely pure Personality of Godhead resides in the spiritual world, which has a golden effulgence."

śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa gives the following derivation of the name Mādhava: "mā"means Lakṣmī

devī, the goddess of fortune. "Dhava"means husband. Therefore "mādhava"means "the husband of the
Goddess of fortune".

In this connection, the Puruṣa-sūkta prayer explains:
śrīś ca te laknmīs ca patnyau

"śrī and Lakṣmī are the wives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

śrīla Bhaktivinoda ṭhākura notes in this regard that śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the principal goddess of fortune,
and therefore the name "Mādhava"also means "the husband of śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī", or the husband of the
gopīs in Vrajabhūmi".

śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes Lord śiva's explanation of the name Madhusūdana:

madhuḥ saṃsāra-nāmeti

tato madhu-nisūdanaḥ

"`Madhu' means the material existance of repeated birth and death, and `nisūdana' means killer. Therefore,

the name Madhusūdana means `He who stops the repetition of birth and death'".

īśvaro vikramī dhanvī
medhāvī vikramaḥ kramaḥ
anuttamo durādharṣaḥ
kṛtajñaḥ krtir ātmavān

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Controller (īśvara), and He is unlimitedly powerful (vikramī). He wields the
transcendental śārṅga bow (dhanvī), and He is supremely intelligent and expert (medhāvī). He can travel
anywhere immediately, even without the help of Garuḍa (vikrama and krama), and there is no one who is
superior or equal to Him (anuttama). The non-devotees cannot approach Him (durādharṣa), and He is very
grateful to they who offer even a small tulasī leaf or forest flower with sincere devotion (kṛtajña). By His
illusory potency, māyā, the conditioned souls engage in fruitive activites (kṛṭi). He keeps an eternal loving
relationship with the liberated souls (ātmavān).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains the word anuttama by citing the Vedic literatures:
na tat samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dlśyate

"No one is superior or equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."(śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8)
mattaḥ parataraṃ nānyat

"O Arjuna, there is no truth superior to Me."(Bhagavad-gītā 7.7)*

The Lord Himself has explained the word kṛtajña:

patraṃ puśpaṃ phalaṃ toyaṃ
yo me bhaktyā prayacchati
tad ahaṃ bhakty-upahṛtam
aṣnāmi prayatātmanaḥ

"If one offers me with love and devotion a leaf, flower, fruit or water, I will accept it."(Bhagavad-gita
9.26)*

sureśaḥ śaraṇaṃ śarma
viśva-retāḥ prajā-bhavaḥ
ahaḥ samvatsaro vyālaḥ
pratyayaḥ śarva-dārśanaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the master of the demigods and the benefactor of the worthy devotees (sureśa). He is the
shelter that removes the distresses of they who approach Him (śaraṇa), and He is full of transcendental bliss
(śarma). He is full of spiritual prowess (viśvaretāḥ) and He is the father of all living entities (prajābhava). He is
like a daytime that causes the conditioned souls to awaken from the long night of material ignorance (ahar),
and He rescues the devotees from the fearful ocean of repeated birth and death (samvatsara). Everything
enters into Him at the time of devastation, and He is the dear friend of śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, Tārakā and Pālī
(vyāla). He is the only person in whom one can completely place his trust (pratyaya). He reveals His form,
qualities, and everything about Himself to the sincere devotees, who have full confidence in the instructions of
the spiritual master and the words of the Vedic literatures (sarvadarśana).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the description of the word śaraṇa found in the Vedic
literatures:

sarvasya śaraṇaṃ suḥrt

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the friend and shelter of all living entities."

The word śarma is described in the śruti-mantra:

ānandaṃ brahma

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full of transcendental bliss."
The Lord Himself describes the word samvatsara:

teśām ahaṃ samuddhartā
mṛtyu-saṃsāra-sāgarāt
bhavāmi mā cirāt pārtha
mayy āveśita-cetasām

"O Son of Pṛthā, for the devotees who have fixed their minds upon Me, I am the swift deliverer from the
ocean of birth and death."(Bhagavad-gītā 12.7)*

The Lord further states:

dadāmi buddhi-yogaṃ taṃ
yena mām upayānti te

"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love I give the understanding by which they can
come to Me."
(Bhagavad-gītā 10.10)*

Lord Kapiladeva gives the following description of the word sarva-darṣana:

paśyanti te me rucirāṇy amba santaḥ

prasanna-vaktrāruṇa-locanāni
rūpāṇi divyāni vara-pradāni

sākaṃ vācaṃ spṛhanīyaṃ vadanti

"O My mother, My devotees always see the smiling face of My form, with eyes like the rising morning sun.
They like to see My various transcendental forms, which are all benevolent, and they also talk favorably with
Me."(śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.25.35)*

ajaḥ sarveśvaraḥ siddhaḥ
siddhiḥ sarvādir acyutaḥ
vṛṣakāpir ameyātmā
sarva-yoga-viniḥsṛtaḥ

Although Lord Kṛṣṇa does not take birth in a material body forced by the laws of karma as an ordinary
living entity, He nevertheless appears within this material world in the abode of Vṛndāvana, just to give
transcendental bliss to His devotees (aja). Lord Kṛṣṇa is the master of Brahmā, all the demigods, and all living
entities (sarveśvara), and He knows everything in the past, present and future (siddha). He is full of unlimited
powers (siddhi), and He is the origin of everything (sarvādi). He protects His devotees from falling down
(acyuta). He fulfills the desires of the devotees and strikes fear into the hearts of the demons (vṛṣakāpi). His
form and intelligence are unlimited and immeasurable, and he is supremely dear to the devotees (ameyātmā).
He is always free from material contact (sarva-yoga-viniḥsṛta).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following description of the word sarvādi, which is found in
the śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.81.19)

svargāpavargayoḥ puṃsāṃ

rasāyāṃ bhuvi sampadām
sarvāsām api siddhānāṃ

mūlaṃ tac-caraṇārcaṇam

"By worshiping Lord Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, one attains both liberation and heavenly happiness within this
world. That worship is the cause of attaining all mystic powers, and all the opulences of the earthly and pātāla
planets."*

The meaning of the name acyuta is explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself in the Bhagavad-gītā (6.30):

tasyāhar na praṇaśyāmi
sa ca me na praṇaśyati

"For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor is he ever lost to Me."*

vasur vasumanāḥ satyaḥ
samātmā sammitaḥ samaḥ
amoghaḥ puṇḍarīkākṣo
vṛṣakarmā vṛṣākṛtiḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa always resides in the hearts of the devotees that relish hearing and chanting His glories (vasu).
He meditates on how to increase the transcendental opulences of the devotees that consider Him their only
wealth (vasu-manāḥ). He never speaks a lie, and He is very dear to the truthful devotees (satya). He accepts
the role of being equal to the devotees who approach Him in sakhya-rasa, or friendship (samātmā). He
magnanimously presents Himself as equal to His devotee (sammita). In order to glorify the devotees related to
Him in friendship and the other rasas, He presents Himself as their equal (sama). He grants His own
supremely valuable devotional service to they who become attached to Him (amogha), and He is always
manifest in the lotus-like hearts of the pure devotees (puṇḍarīkākṣa). He fulfills the desires of the pure
devotees (vṛṣsakarmā), and His transcendental form is supremely handsome (vṛṣākṛti).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains the word vasu by quoting the following sataement of Lord
Kṛṣṇa found in the smṛti-śāstra:

mad-bhaktā yatra gāyanti
tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada

"O Nārada, I remain where My devotees engage in glorifying My activities."*

Queen Kuntīdevī explains the meaning of the word vasu-manāḥ in the following words:
namo 'kiñcana-vittāya

"O Lord Kṛṣṇa, my obeisances are unto You, who are the property of the materially impoverished."*

The name amogha is explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the smṛti-śāstra:

amoghā bhagavad-bhaktir
netareti matir mama

"I am not inclined to give my pure devotional service to anyone and everyone, but I give it to only a few
rare souls."

The name vṛṣākṛti is explained in the smṛti-śāstra:

bibhrad vapuḥ sakala-sundara sanniveśaṃ
karmācaran bhuvi sumaṅgalam āpta-kāmaḥ

"Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental form is supremely handsome and auspicious. All His desires are
automatically fulfilled. He appeared on this earth planet and performed His transcendental pastimes."

Lord Kṛṣṇa cures the disease of material existance afflicting the conditioned souls (rudra), and He appears
as the thousand-headed Lord Anantadeva (bahu-śirāḥ). He is the maintainer (babhru) and creator (viśvayoni)
of millions of universes. He is supremely pure, and He cleanses whatever impurity may contaminate the
hearts of His genuine devotees (śuci-śravāḥ). His handsomeness is as sweet as nectar, and He rescues the
devotees from the cycle of repeated birth, old-age and death (amṛta). He is eternal (śāśvata), and He eternally
apears before the pure devotees and grants them transcendental bliss (sthānu). He always remains in His
eternal abode, Goloka Vṛndāvana, and he rescues His devotees from the cycle of birth and death (varāroha).
He is Himself the original cause of the multiple distresses of material existance (mahā-tapāḥ).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following description of the name rudra found in the smṛtiśāstra:

rujaṃ drāvayate yasmād rudras tasmāj janārdanaḥ

"Because Lord Janārdana cures the sickness that is material life, He is known as Rudra."

The name bahu-śirāḥ is described in the puruṣa-sūkta prayers:

sahasra-śirṣā puruṣaḥ

"The Supreme Person appears as the thousand-headed Lord Anantadeva."

Lord Kṛṣṇa explains the meaning of the name śuci-śravāḥ in the following verse from the smṛti-śāstra:

śucīni sravaṇīyāni

śṛṇomīha dhanañjaya
na ca pāpāni gṛhṇāmi

tato 'haṃ vai śuci-śravāḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa is present everywhere in the material manifestation composed of 24 elements, and He
reciprocates the loving service rendered by His devotees (sarvaga). He knows everything auspicious and
inauspicious and He knows all the spiritual and material worlds (sarva-vit). He is like a brilliant sun shining in
this world (bhānu). His associates are like a host of armies stationed in every corner of the universe for it's
protection (viṣvaksena). He crushes the demons that seek to destroy the world and He protects the saintly
devotees, removing all their sufferings (janārdana). He is manifested as the Vedic hymns (veda), and He is the
knower of the Vedas (veda-vit). He is not directly described in the six Vedāṅgas, which describe grammar,
astronomy, and similar subjects (avyaṅga). The Vedic literatures comprise His instructions (vedāṅga). He is
the most expert theologian, philosopher and poet (kavi).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the description of the word veda, found in the smṛti-śāstra:

vedo nārāyaṇaḥ sākṣāt

"The Vedas are a direct manifestation of Lord Nārāyaṇa."

The name veda-vit is described by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself in the Bhagavad-gītā (15.15):

vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham

"I am the compiler of Vedānta, and I am the knower of the Vedas."*

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the master of the Vaiṣṇavas, who engage in His devotional service and He is also the master
of the vaidika-brāhmaṇas, who worship Him by the performance of agnihotra-yajñas (lokādhyakṣa). He is the
master of all the demigods (surādhyakṣa), the superintendent of religious principles, and the judge of all living
entities (dharmādhyakṣa). He is completely free from material contact (kṛtākṛta) and He has expanded

Lord Kṛṣṇa is effulgent (bhrajiṣṇu), and He supplies the neccessities of life to all living entities (bhojana).
He relishes foodstuffs and other things offered to Him with devotion, and He is the protector of the gentle
devotees (bhoktā). He is intolerant of the demons (asahiṣṇu) and tolerant of the offenses accidentally
committed by His devotees (sahiṣṇu). He is the father of Lord Brahmā, the first living being to appear in the
universe (jagad-ādija). Even though He appears in this material world, He remains always pure and full of
transcendental bliss, free form this world's contamination (anagha). He is always victorious (vijaya) and He is
the Supreme Person because He can defeat any demigod or living entity (jetā). He is the original creator of all
universes (viśva-yoni), and He appears within this material world again and again to protect the devotees
(punar-vasu).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes Lord Brahmā's explanation of the word jagad-ādija found in the
smṛti-śāstra:

yasya prasādād aham acyutasya

Lord Kṛṣṇa is Indra's younger brother (upendra), who appeared as a young brahmacārī to help Indra and
cheat Bali Mahārāja (vāmana). In this incarnation the Lord became so tall He could immediately step over the
entire universe (prāṃśu). His activities are always successful (amogha), and He is supremely pure (śuci). He is
so powerful (ūrjita) that He easily defeated Bali's army, and He surpasses the strength of Indra (atīndra). He
accepts they who become devoted to Him (saṅgraha). He created the demigods and everything else (sarga).
He enchants and delights the hearts and minds of Indra and the other devotees (dhṛtātmā). He controls the
devotees (niyama) and He resides in their hearts and minds (yama).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa observes that the names in this verse all describe the Lord's incarnation
as Vāmanadeva. The smṛti-śāstra describes Lord Vāmana in the following way:

dvādaśaivāditeḥ putrāḥ

śakra-mukhyā narādhipa
teṣām avarajo viṣṇur

yatra lokāḥ pratiṣṭhitāḥ

"O King, Aditi gave birth to twelve sons. The eldest son was Indra, and the youngest of Her sons was
Vāmana, who was actually Lord Viṣṇu, in whom all planetary systems rest."

The name prāṃśu is described in the smṛti-śāstra:

toye tu patite haste

vāmano 'bhūd avāmanaṇ
sarva-devamayaṃ rūpaṃ

darśayām āsa vai bhuvi

"Although Lord Vamana was a very short small boy, He quickly expanded His form to include all the

vedyo vaidyaḥ sadā-yogī
viraho mādhavo madhuḥ
atīndriyo mahā-māyo
mahotsāho mahā-balaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared as Kūrma-avatāra to deliver nectar to the demigods and remove their poverty
(vedya). He appeared as Lord Dhanvantari, the original physician, who cures the people's diseases simply by
the expansion of His fame. As Lord Dhanvantari, He gave nectar to the demigods (vaidya). He always acts for
the welfare of the demigods (sadā-yogī). He kills the powerful demons such as Kaṃsa and the demons eager to
fight the demigods to attain the nectar churned from the ocean of milk (viraha). He is the husband of Lakṣmīdevī,
who appeared from the ocean of milk (mādhava). With His handsomeness and charm He enchanted
Lakṣmī-devī and all the pious demigods (madhu). Removing the nectar from the possession of the demigods,
He disappeared, because He always remains invisible to they who have no devotion to Him (atīndriya). He
then appeared in the attractive female form of Mohinī-mūrti to bewilder the demons and also Lord śiva
(mahā-māya). In this way He earnestly endeavored to make the demigods' plans successful (mahotsāha), and
He displayed His great prowess, which can thwart or bewilder anyone (mahā-bala).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa observes that the names in this verse describe the Lord's incarnations
(Kūrma, Dhanvantari and Mohinī-mūrti) that appeared when the demigods and demons jointly churned the
ocean of milk.

The smṛti-śāstra describes the name viraha:

suparṇa-pakṣābhihatā nipetur dānavarśabhāḥ

"When Lord Viṣṇu fought the demons, He rode on Garuḍa. Simply by the blows from Garuḍa's wings,
the demons fell in the battle."

The name mādhava may also mean "the master of all transcendental knowledge". This is confirmed by the
following statement of Lord śiva:

māvidyā ca hareḥ proktā

tasyām īśo yato bhavān
tasmān mādhava-nāmāsi

pūrvam asīti śabditaḥ

"O Lord Hari, knowledge of transcendence is known as mā, and because you are the master of all such
transcendental knowledge, You are known as `mādhava'".

Lord Kṛṣṇa is supremely intelligent (mahā-buddhi), supremely powerful (mahā-vīrya), and the master of all
transcendental potencies (mahā-śakti). He is supremely splendid (mahā-dyuti) and His transcendental form
cannot be seen by material eyes (anirdeśya-vapuḥ). He is supremely handsome (śrīmān), and His unlimited
nature cannot be measured by any living entity or demigod (ameyātmā). Appearing as Lord Kūrma, He held
up the Mandara Mountain (mahādri-dhṛk).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa comments that Lord Kṛṣṇa used His great prowess (mahā-vīrya) to
take the nectar on behalf of the demigods, and He used His great potency (mahā-śakti) to bewilder the
demons and bring them under His control.

A further explanation of the name mahā-dyuti is found in the following description by śrīla śukadeva
Gosvāmī:

megha-śyāmaḥ kanaka-paridhiḥ karṇa-vidyoti-vidyun-

mūrdhi-bhrājad-vilulita-kacaḥ srag-dharo rakta-netraḥ
jaitrair dorbhir jagad-ubhayadair daṇḍaśūkaṃ gṛhītvā

mantha-manthan prati girir ivāśobhatātho dhṛtādriḥ

"The Lord appeared like a blackish cloud. He was dressed with yellow garments, earrings shone on His ears
like lightning, and His hair was spread over His shoulders. He wore a garland of flowers and His eyes were
pinkish. With His strong glorious arms, which award fearlessness throughout the universe, He took hold of
Vasuki, and began churning the ocean, using Mandara Mountain as a churning rod. When engaged in this way,

the Lord appeared like a splendid sapphire mountain."

devotees (satāṃ gatiḥ) and He cannot be controlled by anything except pure devotional service (aniruddha).
He gives transcendental bliss to the devotees and demigods (surānanda) and He gives pleasure to the cows,
land and senses (govinda). With His spiritual effulgence He removes all obstacles from the path of His
devotees (govindāṃ patiḥ).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa observes that the first four names in this verse describe the Lord's
expansions that are worshiped in different parts of the universe. Lord Maheṣvāsa is worshiped in Kimpuruṣavarṣa,
Lord śrīnivāsa is worshiped in Ketumāla-varṣa. Lord Satāṃ Gatiḥ is worshipped by devotees
throughout the entire universe.

The remaining names in this verse describe the Lord as He appears in the abode of śvetadvīpa.

Lord Kṛṣṇa is effulgent (marīci) and He removes the distresses of His devotees (damana). He appeared as a
swan to enlighten Lord Brahmā and the four Kumāras (haṃsa). In His form as Lord Viṣṇu He reclines on
Ananta-śeṣa (bhujagottama) and is carried by Garuḍa (suparṇa). His beautiful navel is splendid as gold
(hiraṇyanābha). He appeared before the great devotees worshiping Him with great austerities (sutapāḥ) and
His navel is as beautiful as a lotus flower (or He appears before the pure devotees who worship His lotus feet)
(padmanābha). He is the master and protector of śiva, Brahmā, and all other living entities (prajāpati).

Note śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa comments that Lord Kṛṣṇa
appeared in the form of a swan because a swan can discriminate between milk and water, accepting only the
milk and rejecting the water when they are mixed together. Just as the swan discriminates in this way, the Lord
distinguished the actual truth from that which is only illusion.

innumerable universes, and He appeared as Lord Rāmacandra, the most expert archer (sandhātā). In His plan
to kill Rāvaṇa and rescue Sītā, He became the ally of Sugrīva (sandhimān). He is the constant friend of
Vibhīṣanā and all who approach to take shelter of Him (sthira). He never takes birth in a material body, and
he never abandons His friend (aja). He is merciful (durmarṣaṇa) and also expert at punishing the demons
(śāstā). He is famous (as Lord Rāma, who is very merciful to the devotees, and who is the killer of Rāvaṇa)
(viśrutātmā). He is the killer of Rāvaṇa and other demons, who are always enimical to the demigods and
devotees (surārihā).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the śruti-mantra to explain the name sarva-dṛk. The śruti
explains "yaḥ sarvajñaḥ"(the Supreme Personality of Godhead is omniscient).

The commentator explains that, beginning with the name sandhātā, the names in this verse refer to the
Lord's appearance as Lord Rāmacandra, the son of Mahārāja Daśaratha.

The name aja is explained by Lord Rāmacandra Himself in the following way:

mitra-bhāvena samprāptaṃ
na tyajeyaṃ kathañcana
dośo yadyapi tasmin syāt
satām etad vigarhitam
sakṛd eva prapanno yas
tavāsmīti ca yācate
abhayaṃ sarvadā tasmai
dadāmy etad vrataṃ mama

"If one becomes My friend, then I shall never leave Him, and even if His character is very faulty, I shall not
take His faults very seriously. If one surrenders to Me even once, and even once says `O Lord, from today I am
Yours', I continually protect Him from all dangers and make Him fearless. This is My vow."

gurur gurutamo dhāma
satyaḥ satya-parākramaḥ
nimiṣo 'nimiṣaḥ sragvī
vācaspatir udāra-dhīḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa empowers the initiating and instructing spiritual masters to benefit the residents of the material
world (guru). He is Himself the best of spiritual masters who taught Brahmā and other great devotees
(gurutama). He is the shelter and resting place of everything (dhāma). He is the benefactor of Viśvāmitra and
the other saintly devotees, and He is always truthful (satya). His extraordinary prowess is supremely
auspicious (satya-parākrama). He blinks, not recognizing the merit of sinful actions (nimiṣa) and he never
blinks in His continual recognition of the auspicious actions of devotional service (animiṣa). He wears a
vaijayantī garland (sragvī) and He is the protector of Sarasvatī (vācaspati). He is generous (udāra-dhī).

Note śrila Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains that the Lord's generosity may be seen by the fact that He
liberally granted to Guha, Jaṭāyu, Sabarī, and many others the great treasure of His lotus feet, which is difficult
to attain even by becoming the most learned Vedic scholar.

agraṇīr grāmaṇīḥ śrīmān-
nyāyo netā samīraṇaḥ
sahasra-mūrdhā viśvātmā
sahasrākṣaḥ sahasra-pāt

Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared as Matsya-avatāra and rescued the Vedas, which were tied to His horn by the rope of
Vasuki-nāga (agraṇīḥ). As He pulled Lord Manu and the other sages in a golden boat, Lord Matsya enjoyed
pastimes on the waters of the ocean of devastation (grāmaṇīḥ). Lord Matsya spoke the message of the Vedas
and protected the Vedas at the time of devastation (śrīmānnyāa). He is the leader of all living entities (netā),
and He moves about with consummate grace (samīraṇa). Appearing with uncountable thousands of heads
(sahasra-mūrdhā), uncountable thousands of eyes (sahasrākṣa), and uncountable thousands of feet (sahasrapāt),
Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Soul who pervades the entire universe (viśvātmā).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa observes that the first two lines of this verse describe the Lord's
universal form, which is also described in the Bhagavad-gītā (13.14):

sarvataḥ paṇi-pādaṃ tat

sarvato 'kṣi-śiro-mukham
sarvataḥ śrutimal loke sarvam āvṛtya tiṣṭhati

"Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes and faces, and He hears everything."*

āvarttano nivṛttātmā
samvṛtaḥ sampratardanaḥ
ahaḥ samvartako vahnir
anilo dharaṇī-dharaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who causes the conditioned souls to rotate in the cycle
of birth
and death (āvarttana), although He Himself is full of all apiritual opulences and He resides in the eternal
spiritual world, free from any material contact (nivṛttātmā). He remains always invisible to the conditioned
souls who are very eager to attain the tiny happinesses of material existance (samvṛta), and He causes distress
to the demons who are opposed to Him, even if they assume the forms of so-called scholars, saintly persons or
demigods (sampratardana). He is Himself the succession of days (or He speaks very eloquently and sweetly
(aha). He is time itself (samvartaka), and with part of Himself He carries the weight of the entire universe
(vahni). Supremely independent, at various times He voluntarily descends to this material world for the
welfare of the conditioned souls (anila). He is the maintainer of the earth (dharaṇī-dhara).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following explanation of the name āvarttana from the śrutimantra:

tenedaṃ bhramyate brahma-cakram

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead causes the living entities to rotate in the cycle of birth and death."

The śruti-mantra gives the following explanation of the name nivṛttātmā:

tri-pād urddhū udaita puruṣaḥ

"The Supreme Person resides in the eternal spiritual world, which is three-quarters of the entirety of
existance."

The śruti-mantra also gives the following explanation of the name samvartaka:

samvartako yaḥ kālaḥ

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is manifested as the time-factor."

The śruti-mantra explains the name dharaṇī-dhara:

sa dadhāra pṛthivīm

The Supreme Personality of Godhead maintains the earth."

suprasādaḥ prasannātmā
viśva-dhṛg viśva-bhug vibhuḥ
sat-kartā sat-kṛtaḥ sādhur

Lord Kṛṣṇa is very merciful (suprasāda). His desires are always fulfilled, and His heart and mind are always
clear and pure (prasannātmā). He maintains (viśva-dhṛk) and protects (viśva-bhuk) the multitude of material
universes, and He is the all-pervading, all-powerful, unlimited, and fearless Supreme Controller (vibhu). He is
the benefactor of the demigods, pitās, brāhmaṇas and devotees (sat-kartā) and He is worshiped by them (satkṛta).
He is the benefactor of all living entities and His eternal spiritual form is free from any touch of matter
(sādhu). He defeats the enemies of His devotees (jahnu), and He is the shelter within whom all living entities
rest, as well as the destroyer of ignorance (nārāyaṇa). He is the Supersoul who resides in the hearts of all
beings (nara).

Note: śrila Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains that the names in this verse indicate the Lord's form of a small
child resting on a banyan leaf at the time of universal annihilation.
The Lord's feature as viśva-dhṛk (holder of the universes) is seen when He caused all the universes to exit
from His body with His exhaling breath, thus astonishing Mārkaṇḍeya ṛṣi.

The name jahnu (defeater of enemies) may also describe, when, appearing as Nara-Nārāyaṇa ṛṣi, the Lord
defeated many apsarās sent by Indra, and when the Lord also defeated śiva, who was very eager to fight with
Him.

The smṛti-śāstras explain the name Nārāyaṇa:

narāj jātāni tattvāni
narānīti vidur budhāḥ
tasya tāny ayanaṃ pūrvaṃ
tena nārāyānaḥ smṛtaḥ

"From Lord Viṣṇu (nara) all the living entities have emanated. For this reason, the living entites are known
as nāra
(born from nara). Because the Lord is the resting place (ayana) of the total group of living entities (nāra), the
learned sages call Him Nārāyaṇa."

viśiṣṭaḥ śiṣṭa-kṛc chuciḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental attributes cannot be counted (asaṅkhyeya), His patience is unlimited
(aprameyātmā). and His opulences are unlimited (viśiṣṭa). He gives His devotees great faith in the message of
the Vedas, and thus transforms them into the most elevated of peaceful saintly persons (śiṣṭa-kṛt). Simply by
hearing about Him of or remembering Him, all living entities become purified and the entire world becomes
an auspicious place (śuci). All His desires are automatically fulfilled (siddhārtha and siddha-saṅkalpa), and it is
He who fulfills the desires of all living entities (siddhida). Simply by remembering Him, the devotees become
successful in their devotional activities, and freed from all impediments (siddhi-sādhana).

Note: śrila Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains the name aprameyātmā (unlimitedly patient), by recounting
the pastimes of Nara-Nārāyaṇa ṛṣi. The Lord remained unidsturbed when the damsels sent by Indra tried to
distract Him from His vow of celibacy. At that time the Lord manifested by His own potency a host of
transcendental beautiful girls much more beautiful than the young soldiers of Indra, and thus casually
frustrated their attempt to break His vow, and caused them to become very astonished.

Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental qualities eclipse the glory of Indra (vṛṣāhī). Lord Kṛṣṇa illuminates and
protects the entire world by teaching the principles of devotional service (vṛṣabha), and He is all-pervading,
present in every atom of the cosmic manifestation (viṣṇu). He is a jubliant festival for Indra and the best of the
yogīs (vṛṣaparvā), and he protects Indra in the same way a mother protects her child (vṛṣodara). He causes the
prajāpatis to prosper (vardhana) and He considers even the smallest gift given by His pure devotee to be very
great (vardhamāna). Although He is present in every corner of the cosmic manifestation, He remains always
free from material contact (vivikta). He is like an ocean in which all the rivers of Vedic knowledge converge
(śruti-sāgara).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes Lord śiva's explanation of the name Viṣṇu:

vyapya sarvān imān lokān

sthitaḥ sarvatra keśavaḥ
tataś ca viṣṇu-nāmāsi

viśer dhātoḥ pradarṣanāt

"The verb viś means 'to enter'. Because Lord Keśava is all-pervading and present in every corner of every
planet, as well as in the hearts of all living beings, He is therefore known as 'Viṣṇu'."

The name vardhana begins the list of the names of the Hayagrīva incarnation of the Lord.

With His two strong arms, Lord Kṛṣṇa grants fearlessness
to the devotees, and also protects the Vedas (subhuja). He cannot be defeated by Madhu, Kaiṭabha, or any
other demon (durdhara). He is the proper object of eloquent prayers, and He is Himself supremely eloquent
(vāgmī). He is the supreme monarch, who possess all opulences (mahendra). He defeats the demons, gives
shelter to the living entities, and grants the nectarean mellows of love of God to the pure devotees (vasuda).
He appears before they who understand His transcendental glories, and thus He becomes their only wealth
(vasu). He appears in many different forms to satisfy the desires of His devotees (naika-rūpa). His
transcendental from is larger than everything (bṛhad-rūpa). He enters the waters of devastation, and causes
the inundation at the end of the universe (śipi-viṣṭa). He is the original cause of the cosmic manifestation (or
he rescued the Vedas from the demons Madhu and Kaiṭabha) (prakāśana.)

of all transcendental opulences (ṛdhha). mHe teaches the message of the Vedas (spaṣṭākṣara), and He reveals
the truth of His confidential pastimes to the most exalted and intimate devotees (mantra). He is splendid as

defeats the atheists (śaśabindu) and He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, understood by the theists
(sureśvara). Devotional service to Him is the nectar-medicine that counteracts the poisnous snake-bite of
material existance (auṣadham). He is the enemy of the demons (jagataḥ setuḥ). He defeats the impersonalists
and establishes the actual truth of spiritual variety (satya-dharma-parākrama).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following description of the name amṛtāṃśūdbhava found in
the śruti-śāstra:

candramā manaso jātaḥ

"The moon is born from the mind of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

supreme handsomeness and the object of the aspirations of the saintly paramahaṃsas (kānta). He is the source
of all that is desirable, even for the buddhists and other bewildered living beings, (kāma) and it is He who

sucession of four yugas (yugāvarta). He preaches the specific processes of spiritual realization intended for
each yuga (naika-māya), and He is full of transcendental knowledge, opulences and renunciation (mahāśana).
He is invisible to the uncivilized and demonic (adṛśya) and His form in unlimited (vyakta-rūpa). He defeats
thousands of uncivilized atheists (sahasra-jit). He defeats unlimited numbers of atheists (ananta-jit).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa observes that the first four names in this verse describe the Lord's

Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshiped and glorified by Brahmā, śiva, and all demigods and saintly persons (iṣṭa).
Holding the sudarṣana-cakra, club, lotus and conch, and decorated with the kaustubha jewel and other
ornaments, He is splendidly manifest in the city of Mathurā (viśiṣṭa). He is worshiped by they who know the
purpose of the Vedas (śiṣṭeṣṭa). In His Vṛndāvana pastimes He is crowned with a peacock feather (śikhaṇḍī).
His handsomeness enchanted the minds of the residents of Vrajabhūmi (nahuṣa) and He showered upon them
a nectar rain of transcendental bliss and pure love of God (vṛṣa). When, hearing the description of His naughty
childhood pranks, Mother Yaśodā became angry, He pacified Her with sweet words (krodhahā), but when she
interrupted feeding Him to tend to the overflowing pot of boiling milk, He became angry and broke the
butter-pot (krodha-kṛt). He killed the host of demons sent to Vṛndāvana by Kaṃsa (kartā), and He protects
the entire universe with His powerful arms (viśva-bāhu). He lifted Govardhana Hill to protect the residents of
Vrajabhūmi (mahī-dhara).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following description of the name viśiṣṭa, found in the
śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.3.9):

"Lord Kṛṣṇa then appeared in Mathurā as the newborn child of Vasudeva and Devakī. Lord Kṛṣṇa had
wonderful lotuslike eyes and He bore in His hands the four weapons, śaṅkha, cakra, gadā and padma. On His
chest was the mark of śrīvatsa and on His neck the brilliant kaustubha gem. He was dressed in yellow, and His
body was blackish like a dense cloud."*

The following description of krodhahā is found in the śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.8.31):

"Sometimes all the gopīś would look at Kṛṣṇa sitting there, His eyes fearful so that His mother would not
chastise Him, and when they saw Kṛṣṇa's beautiful face, instead of chastising Him, they would simply look
upon His face and enjoy transcendental bliss. Mother Yaśodā would mildly smile at all this fun, and she would
not want to chastise her blessed transcendental son."*

Lord Kṛṣṇa is eternal and unchanging, and He is the protector of the residents of Vraja (acyuta). He is
famous in Vrajabhūmi and the entire universe (prathita). He is the object of the pure love of the residents of
Vraja (prāṇa) and He is the source of their strength and their very life (prāṇada). Even though Indra offended
Him by trying to flood Vṛndāvana with rain, Kṛṣṇa kindly appeared before him (vāsavānuja). After He had
forgiven Indra's offenses, Kṛṣṇa was bathed with the milk of the surabhi cows, who thus proclaimed that Lord
Kṛṣṇa was their Indra (apāṃ-nidhi). Lord Kṛṣṇa is personally manifest as the transcendental abode of
Māthura and the other places where He performed pastimes (adhiṣṭhānam). He protects the residents of
Vrajabhūmi with great care and attention (apramatta), and he is respected by all the cowherd men because He
is the son of Nanda Mahārāja, the king of Vraja (pratiṣṭhita).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes King Indra's explanation of the name apāṃ-nidhi:

ahaṃ kilendro devāṇāṃ

tvam gavām indratāṃ gataḥ

"Although I am the indra who rules over the demigods you are the indra of these transcendental surabhi
cows."*

śukadeva Gosvāmī also confirms:

indro gavām

"Lord Kṛṣṇa is the indra of the transcendental surabhi cows."

The name adhiṣṭhānam is described in the śruti-mantra:

sākṣād brahma gopāla-purī

"The transcendental abode of Māthura is a direct incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Himself."

The smṛti-śāstra further explains:

pañca-yojanam evāsti
vanaṃ me deha-rūpakam

The transcendental land of Vṛndāvana, which is five yojanas in area, is a direct manifestation of My own
transcendental form."

In the Vedic literatures, Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself explains the name apramatta:

tasmān mac-charaṇaṃ goṣṭhaṃ

man-nāthaṃ mat-parigraham
gopāya svātma-yogena

so 'yaṃ me vrata āhitaḥ

"I vow that with My own internal potency I shall always protect the cows, cowherd men and gopīs who
reside in Vṛndāvana and who have all taken shelter of Me and depend upon Me. I vow that I shall alwyas
protect my dear parents and my relatives and friends who reside here."

Lord Kṛṣṇa removed the lamentation of the earth (aśoka) and also removed the fear inspired in the hearts
of the devotees by demonic rulers who were actually only theives disguised as kings (tāraṇa). He removes the
devotee's fear of repeated birth, old-age, disease and death (tāra). He is very powerful and heroic (śura) and
He appeared in the dynasty of the great devotee and powerful King Devamīḍa (śauri). He is the king that
ruled over the citizens of Mathurā, delighting them with great transcendental bliss, and He is also the supreme
ruler of all living entities in both the spiritual and material worlds (janeśvara). He is the kind well-wisher of the
residents of Māthura, and all other living entities also (anukūla), and His transcendental opulence and prowess
bewilder both the demons, headed by Kaṃsa, and also the devotees, headed by Nārada (śatāvarta). He
playfully holds a lotus flower (padmī), His eyes are as beautiful as lotus flowers, and He resides in His eternal
abode of Gokula, which appears like a great lotus flower (padma-nibhekṣaṇa).

Note śrila Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains that the name padmi has another menaing which is very
confidential. Padmī may mean: "Lord Kṛṣṇa who appears like a blue lotus flower and who is accompanied by
śrīmati Rādhārāṇī, who appears like a golden lotus flower which grows inthe waaters of pure love of
Godhead. Those two lotus flowers are surrounded by innumerable other lotus flowers, which are the gopīs,
who are all expansions of śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī."

The transcendental abode of Gokula (padma-nibhekṣaṇa) is described in the following verse from the
Brahma-saṃhitā (5.2):

sahasra-patrar kamalar

gokulākhyar mahat padam
tat-karṇikārar tad dhāma

tad anantārśa-sarbhavam

"The superexcellent station of Kṛṣṇa, which is known as Gokula, has thousands of petals and a corolla like
that of a lotus sprouted from a part of His infinitary aspect, the whorl of the leaves being the actual abode of
Kṛṣṇa."*

Lord Kṛṣṇa's navel is like a lake from which has sprouted the lotus flower that is the place of Brahmā's
birth (padma-nābha). Lord Kṛṣṇa's eyes are like fully-blossomed lotus flowers (aravindākṣa). He always
stands in the lotus-like hearts of the gopīs and other intimate devotees (padma-garbha), and He always
protects the devotees who meditate upon Him seated within their lotus-hearts (śarīra-bhṛt). He is full of all

transcendental opulences (mahardhi), and He is endowed with omniscience and other similar transcendental
powers and qualities (ṛddha). He pervades the universes and enjoys innumerable transcendental pastimes
(vṛddhātmā). His handsome eyes are very large, and His transcendental form cannot be understood with the
limited material senses (mahākṣa). He carries a flag marked with the emblem of Garuḍa (garuḍa-dhvaja).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes Lord Kṛṣṇa's own description of the name śarīra-bhṛt, found in
the smṛti-śāstra:

atulaḥ śarabho bhīmaḥ
samayajño havir-hariḥ
sarva-lakṣaṇa-lakṣaṇyo
lakṣmīvān samitiñjayaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental form cannot be compared to anything else (atula). He is like a ferocious
śarabha beast that destroys the demons (śarabha). Although His ferocity strikes fear into the demons' hearts,
He nevertheless liberates those demons who have the good fortune to be killed by Him (bhīma).
Understanding the devotion borne for Him by His servants, at the appropriate time He gives them the
transcendental result earned by their efforts (samayajña). Situated as the Supersoul within the hearts of His
representatives, the demigods, He personally accepts the clarified butter offered to them in the performance of
Vedic sacrifices (havir-hari). He is endowed with the 32 auspicious signs of a great personality, and all other
auspicious characteristics as well (sarva-lakṣaṇa-lakṣaṇya), and when he appears in His original form as Kṛṣṇa
in Gokula, He is endowed with all transcendental handsomeness and opulence (lakṣmīvān). He is always
victorious in battle (samitiñjaya).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the description of the name atula found in the śruti-mantra:

na tasya pratimā

"Nothing can compare with the transcendental form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

vikṣaro rohito mārgo
hetur dāmodaraḥ sahaḥ
mahī-dharo mahā-bhāgo
vegavān amitāśanaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa is always affectionate to those who take shelter of Him (vikṣara), and He becomes angry at
those who try to harm those who take shelter of Him (rohita). Inspired by His ever fresh transcendental
qualities, the devotees always search for Him, and He also reveals the path of spiritual enlightment to His
devotees (mārga). He inspires great love in the hearts of His devotees, and He is also the origin of everything
(hetu). He allowed His waist to be tied by Mother Yaśod\ā's rope (dāmodara), and He patiently tolerated

Mother Yaśodā's chastisement of Him, which was inspired by pure parental love (saha). His birthday
occasioned a great celebration in Gokula, where His transcendental names, pastimes, and qualities were all
glorified (mahī-dhara). Devotional service to Him is the best of all spiritual activites (mahā-bhāga). He can run
faster than anyone, and is thus always ahead of everyone else, and He also runs quickly as He enthusiastically
plays with His friends, the sons of the cowherd men of Gokula (vegavā n). He assumed a giant form and ate
the innumerable cakes, condensed-milk products and other palatable foods offered to Govardhana Hill by the
cowherd men (amitāśana).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following explanation of the name dāmodara, found in the
smṛti-śāstra:

..... te naiva nāmnātra

kṛṣṇo vai dāma-bandhanāt
goṣṭhe dāmodara iti

gopībhiḥ parigīyate

"Instead of calling Yaśodā's son Kṛṣṇa, the gopīs in Vraja have taken to calling Him Dāmodara, because
His mother bound Him about the waist with a rope."

uddhavaḥ kṣobhaṇo devaḥ

Dragging the mortar between the two yamala-arjuna trees, Lord Kṛṣṇa liberated the two sons of Kuvera
(uddhava). Hearing about Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental qualities, pastimes, and forms, the devotees become
agitated with transcendental bliss (kṣobhaṇa). Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoys transcendental pastimes (deva). He
possesses all the opulences contained within the universe, and he revealed those opulences to mother Yaśodā
when she looked in His mouth to see if He had eaten clay (śrī-garbha). He is the master of śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī,
the supreme goddess of fortune (parameśvara), and the benefactor of His devotees, helping them attain
perfection in bhakti (karaṇam). Using His three potencies He created the material world (kāraṇam). He is the
ultimate creator (kartā). Situated in the heart of the secondary creator, Brahmā, He is the actual creator of all
planets and all living entities (vikartā). The activities of His intelligence are very subtle and can be understood
only by the wise (gahana). He desires to enjoy confidential pastimes with the residents of Vrajabhūmi (guha).

vyavasāyo vyavasthānaḥ
saṃsthānaḥ sthānado dhruvaḥ
pararddhiḥ parama-spaṣṭaḥ
tuṣṭaḥ puṣṭaḥ śubhekṣaṇaḥ

That Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the final conclusion of all Vedic literatures
(vyavasāya), Lord Kṛṣṇa is endowed with innumerable eternal transcendental attributes (vyavasthāna). He is
eternally youthful, and the entire cosmic manifestation enters into Him at the time of annihilation
(saṃsthāna). He gives to His devotees the most desirable station of eternal residence in the spiritual world
(sthānada), and He even becomes the submissive follower of His pure devotee (dhruva). He is endowed with
all transcendental opulences (pararddhi), and for this reason He is glorified in all Vedic literatures (paramaspaṣṭa).
He is full of transcendental bliss (tuṣṭa). The devotees always try to please Him by offering fragrant
incense, palatable foodstuffs, and other pleasing substances (puṣṭa). His merciful glance is the beginning of all

auspiciousness (śubhekṣaṇa).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the description of the name vyavasāya found in śrīmad-
Bhāgavatam (1.3.28):

kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam

"Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the source of all incarnations."*

Lord Kṛṣṇa has personally explained the meaning of the name dhruva in the smṛti-śāstra in the following
way:

nirapekṣaṃ munim śāntaṃ

nirvairaṃ sama-darṣanam
anuvrajāmy ahaṃ nityam

puyeyety aṅghri-reṇubhiḥ

"Because my devotees are indifferent to the temporary happiness and distress of this world, they are always
peaceful, and because they do not consider that anyone is their enemy, they see everyone with an equal eye. I
continually follow these saintly devotees, so that I may become purified by the dust of their lotus feet."

Lord Kṛṣṇa delights the hearts of the yogīs and He enjoys transcendental pasitmes with śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī
and the gopīs of Vṛndāvana (rāma). He is the ultimate boundary within which everything exists (virāma). He is
attained by following the supreme path of pure devotional service (virajo-mārga), and He is submissive to the
devotees who approach Him in friendship (neya). He carries out the orders of His pure devotees (naya), and
they who ignore His orders cannot attain an auspicious destination (anaya). He is the unequalled hero who
casually severed śiśupāla's head and killed many other demons also (vīra). He is the best of all powerful
demigods and yogīs (śaktimatāṃ śreṣṭha), and He is the sustainer of all planets and all living entities (dharma).
He is the maintainer of Manu and all others who know the truth of spiritual life (dharmavid-uttama).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following explanation of the name dharma found in the
smṛti-śāstra:

ye ca veda-vido viprā

ye cādhyātma-vido janāḥ
te vadanti mahātmānaṃ

kṛṣnaṃ dharmaṃ sanātanam

"Learned scholars who know the meaning of the Vedas and saints who know the truth of spiritual life all

vaikuṇṭhaḥ puruṣaḥ prāṇaḥ
prāṇadaḥ praṇavaḥ pṛthuḥ
hiraṇya-garbhaḥ śatrughno
vyāpto vāyur adhokṣajaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of Vaikuṇṭhā-devī, the wife of śubhra, (vaikuṇṭha). He is the supreme
person (puruṣa). He is dear as life for the devotees (prāṇa), and He purifies the devotees' senses (prāṇada).
He is eternally young, and He is worthy of receiving the respectful obeisances of all living entities (praṇava).
He generously considers His devotees equal to Himself (pṛthu). He is knowledge, He is the goal of knowledge,
and He is approached by the cultivation of transcendental knowledge (hiraṇyagarbha). He kills lust, greed,
and all other enemies of His devotees (śatrughna). Attracted by the love of His devotees, he always remains
within their hearts (vyāpta). Many times He defeated Jarāsandha, the king of Magadha (vāyu). He is beyond
the reach of the blunt material senses and, as He rested beneath a cart, He killed the demon śakaṭāsura
(adhokṣaja).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following explanation of the name praṇava, found in the
smṛti-śāstra:

praṇamantīha yaṃ vedas
tasmāt praṇava ucyate

"Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as praṇava because all the personified Vedas offer respectful
oveisances to Him."

The name hiraṇyagarbha is explained in the following way in the Bhagavad-gītā (13.18):

jñānaṃ jñeyaṃ jñāna-gamyam

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the goal of
knowledge."*

In the name adhokṣaja, adhaḥ means beneath, akṣa means the wheel of a cart, and ja means born. In this
word, ja means "born for a second time: or "rescued". This use of the word ja is shown in the following quote
from the smṛti-śāstra:

dadṛśur nihatāṃ tatra

rakṣasīṃ vana-gocarāḥ
punar-jāto 'yam ity āhur

uktas tasmād adhokṣajaḥ

"When the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana saw the giant demoness Pūtanā had been killed by Krṣṇa, they cried
out: "Kṛṣṇa is safe. It is as if He has taken birth for a second time before our eyes."Because the vrajavāsīs
called out in this way, Lord Kṛṣṇa is known as Adhokṣaja."

Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is endowed with all wonderful transcendental attributes, enters the hearts of His pure
devotees, who are all full of love for Him (ṛtu). He is supremely handsome (sudarśana), and he is also the
time-factor, which destroys all things (kāla). He removed the burden of the earth (parameṣṭhī). It should be

understood that the demigods are not supreme, but Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
(parigraha). He assumes a terrible feature to kill the demons (ugra), He always remains with His devotees
(saṃvatsara), and His supreme handsomeness is revealed to the residents of Vṛndāvana (dakṣa). He removed
the gopīs' fatigue during the rāsa dance, and He removes the fatigue of the devotees in general (viśrama). He
will give the entire world, and even Himself, to His pure devotee (viśva-dakṣiṇa).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following description of the name sudarśana, found in the
śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:

yad dharma-sūnor bata rājasūye

nirīkṣya dṛk-svastyayanaṃ tri-lokaḥ
kartsnyena cādyeha gataṃ vidhātur

arvak-sṛtau kauśalam ity amanyata

"All the demigods from the upper, lower, and middle universal planetary systems assembled at the altar of
the rājasūya sacrifice performed by Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. After seeing the beautiful bodily features of Lord
Kṛṣṇa, they all contemplated that He was the ultimate dextrous creation of Brahmā, the creator of human
beings."*

The name viśva-dakṣiṇa is explained in the following quote from the smṛti-śāstra:

dadāty ātmānam apy ajaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa engages in many different loving relationships with His devotees (vistāra). Removing the
burden of the unnecessary defense forces of many demonic kings, Lord Kṛṣṇa restored the earth to a peaceful
condition (sthāvara). At the end of the Kali-yuga He will appear as Lord Kalki to re-establish the Vedic
principles (sthāṇu). He always speaks the truth (pramāṇam), and He is the imperishable seed of all existance
(bījam avyayam). The pure devotees free from material desires strive to attain Him (artha), and those filled
with many desires cannot strive to attain Him, but prefer to worship the demigods to attain heavenly sense-
gratifications in the svarga planets (anartha). He is the master of an unlimited treasury (mahā-kośa), and He is
full of all transcendental opulences (mahā-bhāga). He is the master of all wealth (mahā-dhana).

catur-vidhā mama janā
bhaktā eva hi te smṛtāḥ

eṣām ekantinaḥ śreṣṭhas
te vai vānyad adevatāḥ

aham eva gatis teṣāṃ

nirāśīḥ sarva-karmaṇām
ye tu śiṣṭās trayo bhaktāḥ

phala-kāmā hi te matāḥ

"Four kinds of persons become My devotees: the distressed, those in need of money, the curious, and those
seeking transcendental knowledge. Of these four kinds of men, those seeking transcendental knowledge, who
have Me as the only goal in their life are the best, and the others are considered more or less materialistic. I
am the only goal of the exalted souls who have no desire to atain material benefit by performing various
fruitive activites. The other three kinds of devotees are inferior because they strive to attain some material
results for their endeavors."

The name mahā-dhana is explained in the following statement from the smṛti-śāstra:

kim alabhyaṃ bhagavati

prasanne śrī-niketane

"Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, full of all opulence and all transcendental bliss, and
He is the master of the goddess of fortune. No one can say that Kṛṣṇa requires to obtain something, because
He is already the master of everything in both the spiritual and material worlds."*

Lord Kṛṣṇa is not discouraged by the rebelliousness of the conditioned souls, and He always acts for their
welfare and protection (anirviṇṇa). His form is larger than the cluster of stars known as the śiśumāra-cakra
(sthaviṣṭha) and He appears as the Dhruvaloka planet, about which the other planets revolve (bhū). He is the
pillar upon which all religious principles rest (dharma-yūpa), and all the great Vedic sacrifices are meant for
His satisfaction (mahā-makha). He causes the motion of all the planets (nakṣatra-nemi), and He is the
monarch who rules all planets and stars (nakṣatrī). He controls the movements of the planets (kṣama), and He
is situated within all the planets (kṣāma). Pious persons aspire to attain Him (samīhana).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following description of the name nakṣatra-nemi found in the
smṛti-śāstra:

alāta-cakravad yānti

vāta-cakreritāni tu

supreme object of worship (ijya). He should be worshiped with all grandeur and all royal paraphernalia
(mahejya), and the ritualistic ceremonies prescribed in the Vedas are intended for His worship (kratu). He is
the protector of the devotees, and He is valued by them as their only wealth (satram). Only the pure devotees
are able to attain His association (satāṃ gatiḥ). He see everything, and He especially notices the activities of
His devotees (sarva-darśī). He is free from any material contact (vimuktātmā), and because He is the
Supersoul in the hearts of all creatures, He knows everything (sarvajña). He is the supreme object of
knowledge (jñānam uttamam).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following explanation of the name sarva-darśī:

darśana-dhyāna-saṃsparśair

matsya-kūrma-vihaṅgamāḥ
svāny apatyāni puṣṇanti

face reveals His bliss (sumukha). His spiritual form is eternal and full of knowledge and bliss (sūkṣma). By
expertly playing the flute, He charms and pleases the minds of Brahmā and all other living entities (sughoṣa),
and delights everyone (sukhada). He is the well-wishing friend of the devotees (suhṛt), and the handsomeness
of His three-fold-bending form captures their minds (manohara). Even though ferociously attacked by the
Kāliya serpent, Kṛṣṇa did not become angry, but was merciful to His adversary (ajita-krodha). With His
powerful arms, He can crush the greatest of heroes (vīra-bāhu). Even though Bakāsura was big as a mountain,
Lord Kṛṣṇa easily split his beak as if it were a blade of grass (vidāraṇa).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa comments on the name ajita-krodha by quoting the prayers of the wives of
the Kāliya serpent:

Full of fraternal love, devoted Lord Kṛṣṇa massages the lotus feet of Lord Balarāma, fatigued with the day's
playing, and makes Him fall asleep (svāpana). Kṛṣṇa is supremely independent, and according to His own wish
He convinced the residents of Vraja to worship Govardhana Hill instead of Indra (svavaśa). At every moment
He is present everywhere (vyāpī), and He also expands His original form into innumerable viṣṇu-tattva forms
(naikātmā). He enjoys various wonderful transcendental pastimes to accomodate the varieties of spiritual love
the different devotees bear for Him (naika-karma-kṛt). He personally calls each calf by its own name
(vatsara), and He is also very affectionate to them (vatsala). He is the master of innumerable calves (vatsī). He
is like a most precious jewel born from Yaśodā-devī (ratna-garbha). He is the masterof numberless surabhi
cows (dhaneśvara).

Lord Kṛṣṇa protects the religious principles taught in the Vedas (dharma-gup). He teaches the principles of
religion for the welfare of all living entities (dharma-kṛt). Strictly following religious principles, He sets the
perfect example for everyone (dharmī). He exists eternally in past, present, and future (sat). and He is always
free from lamentation and death (asat). His lotus feet are the supreme object of worship for all living entities,

and He protects the devotees from the demons (kṣaram). He is the sacred syllable oṃ (akṣaram). He excuses
the offenses of those who take shelter of Him (avijñātā). He is omniscient (sahasrāṃśu). He forgives the
offenses of the surrendered souls (vidhātā), and He reveals His original form to the most exalted devotees
(kṛta-lakṣaṇa).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following scriptural explanations of some of the names in this
verse.
The name dharma-gup is explained by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gītā (4.8):
dharma-saṃsthāpanārthāya
sambhavāmi yuge yuge
"In order to re-establish the principles of religion, I appear millenium after millenium."*
The name dharma-kṛt is also explained in the Bhagavad-gītā (3.22) in Lord Kṛṣṇa's own words:
na me parthāsti kartavyaṃ
triṣu lokeṣu kiñcana
nānavāptam avāptavyaṃ

varta eva ca karmaṇi
"O son of Pṛthā, there is no work prescribed for Me within all the three planetary systems. Nor am I in want of
anything, nor have I need to obtain anything-and yet I am engaged in work."*

The from the smṛti-śāstra explains the name sat:
sad eva saumyaḥ
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternal"
The name akṣaram is described in the śruti-śaṣtra:
om ity ātmānaṃ dhyāyatha
"Please meditate on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is manifested in the sacred syllable oṃ."
The name avijñātā is explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the Bhagavad-gītā (9.30):
api cet sudurācāro

bhajate mām ananya-bhāk
sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ

samyag vyavasito hi saḥ
"Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service, he is to be
considered saintly, because he is properly situated."*

The name vidhātā is explained in the śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:
sva-pāda-mūlaṃ bhajataḥ priyasya
tyaktānya-bhāvasya-hariḥ pareśaḥ
vikarma yac cotpatitaṃ kathañcid
dhunoti sarvaṃ hṛdi sanniviṣṭāḥ

"Pure devotees give up everything to exclusively worship the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus they become very
dear to Him. Lord Hari personally appears within the hearts of such devotees, and cleanses away all the
reactions of fruitive activities for them."*

Lord Kṛṣṇa holds the effulgent sudarṣana-cakra to protect the devotees from the messengers of Yamarāja
(gabhasti-nemi), and He remains always situated in the hearts of the pure devotees (sattvastha). He appears
like a ferocious lion to protect the devotees from any Yamadūta who attempts to take them into custody
(siṃha), and He is the absolute monarch who completely controls Yamarāja and his followers (bhūtamaheśvara).
He is the original spiritual master, the teacher of Yamarāja and His followers (ādi-deva). He
relishes the pastimes He performs with His devotees, and He yearns to crush whoever would harm His
devotees (mahādeva). He relishes the pastimes of childhood play performed with His cowherd-boy friends,
and He forgives any offenses they may commit in the course of their playing (deveśa). He is the teacher and
maintainer of Brahmā, śiva and all the demigods (deva-bhṛd guru).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the explanation of the name mahādeva found in the smṛti-śāstra:

bālaḥ krīḍanakair yāvat
krīḍate 'smābhir acyutaḥ

"The infalliable Personality of Godhead accepted the cowherd boys of Vraja as His playmates, and enjoyed
His childhood pastimes in their company."

uttaro gopatir goptā

śarīra-bhūta-bhṛd bhoktā
kapīndro bhūri-dakṣiṇaḥ

Because Lord Kṛṣṇa possesses unlimited wonderful potencies, He is the best of persons (uttara). The sun-god
Sūrya considers Lord Kṛṣṇa His supreme master (gopati), Lord Kṛṣṇa is the protector of all living entities
(goptā), and He is understood by spiritual enlightenment (jñānagamya). He has expanded Himself as the
Supersoul in the bodies of all conditioned souls, and He is the oldest persons (purātana). The transcendental
abode of Vṛndāvana is a manifestation of His own transcendental form (śarīra-bhūta-bhṛt), and He eternally
relishes transcendental pastimes in that land of Vṛndāvana (bhoktā). He is the master of the monkeys of
Vṛndāvana, who participate in His boyhood pastimes (kapīndra). On the celebration of His birthday He gave
abundant charity to the brāhmaṇas (bhūri-dakṣiṇa).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa and śrīla Bhaktivinoda ṭhākura explain that the name jñāna-gamya
implies that merely by performing the pious fruitive activities enjoined in the Vedas for elevation to heavenly

The name śarīra-bhūta-bhṛt is described by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the smṛti-śāstra in the following way:

pañca-yojanam evāsti
vanaṃ me deha-rūpakam

"The land of Vṛndāvana, which extends for five yojanas, is a manifestation of My own transcendental form."

somapo 'mṛtapaḥ somaḥ

vinayo jayaḥ satya-sandho
dāśārhaḥ sāvatāṃ patiḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa protects the demigod śiva (somapa), and He protects all the other demigods as well (amṛtapa).
Lord Kṛṣṇa is very famous and handsome, and He is like a transcendental moon shining over Gokula (soma).
He is very powerful and defeats all His enemies (purujit). He is the best of all living entities (puru-sattama).
He is respectfully served by the Yadus, and He responds by humbly rendering similar service to them (vinaya).
Defeated by the affection the Yadus bear for Him, He has become controlled by them (jaya). He promises to
always protect His devotees (satya-sandha). He is descended from King Daśārha, and He is the most valuable
thing in existance (dāśārha). He is the protector of the Yadus, and the lord and master of the great souls who
preach the truth about Him for the benefit of the conditioned souls (sātvatāṃ patiḥ).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the explanation of the name dāśārha found in the from the smṛtiśāstra:

ataḥ patrataraḥ ko 'nyas
triṣu lokeṣu vidyate
kṛṣṇāt kamala-patrākṣād

devadevāj janārdanāt

"Within the entire expanse of the three planetary systems, what treasure is more valuable than lotus-petaleyed
Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is the master of the demigods and the protector of the devotees?

By giving them the nectar of His association, Lord Kṛṣṇa brings to life the devotees distressed by His absence
(jīva). He protects His devotees as if they were His own children (vinayitā), and He is perfectly aware of How
they are distressed by not being able to associate with Him directly (sākṣī). His smiling face is as beautiful as a
kunda flower (mukunda), and He uses His unlimited prowess to protect His devotees (amita-vikrama). From
Him the Garbhodaka ocean has emanated (ambhonidhi), and He takes rest, reclining on a couch that is the
serpent Anantadeva (anantātmā). He peacefully reclines on Ananta-nāga even when there is a great
inundation at the time of universal destruction (mahodadhi-śaya), and even at this time, He is splendidly
handsome (antaka).

ajo mahārhaḥ svabhāvyo

ānando nandano nandaḥ
satya-dharmā tri-vikramaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa appears to take birth within this material world, although He is unborn (aja). He is the supreme
object of worship (mahārha), and the devotees meditate on Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead

(svabhāvya). He easily defeats lust, anger and all other enemies of His devotees (jitāmitra), and He makes His
pure devotees jubilant, their eyes filled with tears of joy (pramodana, ānanda, nandana, and nanda). His
transcendental form is eternal (satya-dharma), and He is the supreme goal described in the three Vedas (trivikrama).

Note: śrila Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains that the names in this verse refer to the Lord's incarnation as
Kapila Muni, the son of Kardama and Devahūti.

tri-pādas tri-daśādhyākṣo
mahā-śrṅgaḥ kṛtānta-kṛt

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the greatest philosopher, and the greatest scholar of Vedic knowledge (maharṣi), and His
complexion is sometimes manifest as reddish-brown (kapila). He is the original teacher of pure spiritual
knowledge (ācārya), and He was fully aware of the pious deeds performed by Mahārāja Bhagīratha (kṛtajña).
He is the Lord and maintainer of the earth-planet (medinī-pati), and He is manifest as the sacred syllable oṃ,
which consists of the three letters a,u, and m (tri-pada). He is the friend of the demigods, and He rescues them
in times of calamity (tridaśādhyakṣa). As Lord Varāha, He carries the earth on His great tusks (mahā-śṛṅga),
and when He killed the demon Hiraṇyākṣa He was formidable as eternal time (kṛtānta-kṛt).

Note: śrila Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains that the names of Lord Kapila end with krtajña, and the names of
Lord Varāha begin with medinī-pati.

Lord Varāha manifested the form of a gigantic boar, as large as a great mountain (mahā-varāha), and He
found the Earth at the bottom of the rasātala ocean and rescued it (govinda). He is accompanied by a splendid
and invincible army (suśeṇa), and He is decorated with golden armlets, crown, and ornaments (kanakāṅgadī).
It is very difficult to know the truth of His eternal transcendental form (guhya), and He is very difficult to
approach or understand (gabhīra and gahana). He protects the devotees with His transcendental potencies
(gupta), and He carries the sudarṣana-cakra and kaumodakī club (cakra-gadādhara).

Note: The name Govinda may also be interpreted to mean "He who gives pleasure to the cows, land, and
senses."

Lord Kṛṣṇa appointed the various demigods and gave them their respective duties (vedhaḥ), and He is the
original teacher of Vedic knowledge (svaṅga). He is invincible (ajita), and His complexion is dark like a blue
lotus flower (kṛṣṇa). He is extremely powerful (dṛḍha), and He defeated the demon Hiraṇyākṣa (saṅkarṣaṇa).
He is infallible (acyuta), and He may be attained only by those whom He chooses (varuṇa). He always remains

near His devotees (vāruṇa), He accepted the goddess Bhūmi as His wife (vṛkṣa), He entered the waters of the
Garbhodaka Ocean to rescue the Earth, and He sees everything (puṣkarākṣa). He grants liberation to his
devotees (mahā-manāḥ).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the explanation of the name varuṇa found in the Upaniṣads:

yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyaḥ

"Supreme Personality of Godhead may be attained only by those whom He chooses."

Lord Kṛṣṇa possesses all wealth, strength, fame, knowledge, beauty and renunciation (bhagavān), and He kills
the sinful (bhagahā). He is the dear son of Nanda Mahārāja (nandī), and He wears a garland of forest flowers
given to Him by His friends (vana-mālī). His immediate expansion is Lord Balarāma, who holds a club
(halāyudha), and He also appeared as Lord Vāmana, the son of Aditi (āditya). He is as splendid as the sun,
they who remember Him become like demigods, and His splendor is brighter than thousands of demigods
(jyotir-āditya). He is very tolerant, and forgives the offenses of they who take shelter of Him (sahiṣṇu). He
gives the most valuable spiritual destination to they who take shelter of Him (gati-sattama).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following explanation of the name bhagavān, found in the
Viṣṇu Purāṇa (6.5.72--75,79):

śuddhe mahā-vibhūty-ākhye
para-brahmaṇi śabdate
maitreya bhagavac-chabdaḥ

sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇe

"O Maitreya, the word bhagavān may be defined as a name of the Supreme Brahman, who is pure, free from
all material contamination, full of unlimited powers and opulences, and the original cause of all causes."

saṃbharteti tathā bhartā

bha-kārārtho dvayānvitaḥ
netā gamayitā sraṣṭā

ga-kārārthas tathā mune

"O sage, in the word bhagavān, the syllable bha stands for the word bhartā, which means the maintainer of
everything, or the shelter upon whom everything rests, and the syllable ga stands for gamayitā, the leader of
everyone, or the creator and annihilator of the entire cosmic manifestation."

aiśvaryasya samagrasya

vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ
jñāna-vairāgyayoś cāpi

saṇṇāṃ bhaga itīṅganā

"The name bhagavān stands for that Supreme Person who is full in the six opulences (bhaga) of all wealth,
strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation."*

vasanti tatra bhūtāni

bhūtātmany akhilātmani
sa ca bhūteṣv aśeṣeṣu

va-kārārthas tato 'vyayaḥ

"In the word bhagavān, the syllable va stands for the verb vas (to reside), because He is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in whom the entire creation rests, and also because He is the Supersoul, who remains
in the hearts of all conditioned souls. The syllable va also stands for the word avyaya (unchanging), which
indicates that the Supreme Person is eternally the same."

sudhanvā khaṇḍa-paraśur
dāruṇo draviṇa-pradaḥ

vācaspatir ayonijaḥ

Lord Paraśurāma carries a splendid bow (sudhanvā), and an axe that he used to kill the kṣatriyas (khaṇḍaparaśu).
He was merciless to the kṣatriyas (dāruṇa), and after killing all the kṣatriyas, he performed a sacrifice
in which He gave the entire earth in charity to the brāhmaṇas (draviṇa-prada). Lord Kṛṣṇa also appeared as
Vyāsadeva, the great philosopher who explained the truth of the spiritual world (diva-spṛk), and divided the
single Veda into four (sarva-ṛg-vyāsa). He is the eloquent author of the Purāṇas and Mahābhāata (vācaspati),
and Sarasvatī, the goddess of learning, personally appeared in His words (ayonija).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa observes that the names in the first part of this verse describe the Lord's
incarnation as Paraśurāma and the names in the second half of the verse describe Lord Vyāsadeva.

trisāmā sāmagaḥ sāma
nirvāṇaṃ bheṣajaṃ bhiṣak
sannyāsa-kṛc chamaḥ śānto
niṣṭhā-śānti-parāyaṇaḥ

Appearing as Lord Vyāsadeva, Lord Kṛṣṇa divided the Veda into three parts (trisāmā). Lord Vyāsa took
pleasure in singing the Vedic hymns (sāmaga), and He taught those hymns to His disciples (sāma), freeing
them from ignorance and liberating them from material bondage (nirvāṇam). In this way He became the
physician (bhiṣak) that administered the medicine of Lord Kṛṣṇa's devotional service, which freed them from
the disease of material ignorance (bheṣajam).In His pastimes as Lord Caitanya, Lord Kṛṣṇa accepts the
sannyāsa order (sannyāsa-kṛt), and He is equipoised (sama) and peaceful (śānta). He is the highest abode of
peace and devotion, for He silences the impersonalist non-devotees (niṣṭhā-śānti-parāyaṇa).

Note: Lord Caitanya accepted sannyāsa, leaving aside His householder life, to preach His misssion. He has
equanimity in different senses. First, He describes the confidential truth of the Personality of Godhead, and
second, He satisfies everyone by knowledge and attachment to Kṛṣṇa. He is peaceful because He renounces all
topics not related to the service of Kṛṣṇa. śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa has explained that the word niṣṭhā
indicates His being rigidly fixed in chanting the holy name of śrī Kṛṣṇa. Lord Caitanya subdued all disturbing

opponents of devotional service, especially the monists, who are actually averse to the personal feature of the
Supreme Lord.*

śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa also quotes the prediction of Lord Caitanya's appearance which is found in the
śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (11.5.32):

kṛṣṇa-varṇaṃ tviṣākṛṣṇaṃ

sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam
yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair

yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ

"In the age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational chanting to worship the incarnation of
Godhead who constantly sings the name of Kṛṣṇa. Although His complexion is not blackish, He is Kṛṣṇa
Himself. He is accompanied by His associates, servants, weapons, and confidential companions."*

(The second part of this verse and the whole of the footnote, the part describing Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu,
is taken from His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda's translation of śrī Caitanyacaritāmṛta,
Adi-līlā, Chapter 3, verse 49.)

śubhāṅgaḥ śāntidaḥ sraṣṭā

The handsome features of Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental body charm the minds of the residents of Vṛndāvana
(śubhāṅga), and His gentle smile makes them very peaceful at heart and inspires in them great feelings of love
for Him (śāntida). He creates at every moment a treasure-house of transcendental bliss, which becomes the
property of the residents of Vṛndāvana (sraṣṭā), and He also becomes happy enjoying pastimes with His
brother, Balarāma, in the land of Vṛndāvana (kumuda). He enchanted the residents of Vṛndāvana by causing
them to continually drink the nectar of the sound of His flute (kuvaleśaya). He is the well-wisher and
benefactor of the cows (gohita), their master and controller (gopati), and their protector as well (goptā). He
killed the Ariṣṭāsura demon, who appeared in the form of a bull to kill the residents of Vṛnāvana (vṛṣabhākṣa),
and after the demon was killed, He carefully protected the bulls and cows of Vṛndāvana, who were all very
dear to Him (vṛs_apriya).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the explanation of the name kumuda found in the śrīmad-
Bhāgavatam (10.11.36):

vṛndāvanaṃ govardhanaṃ

yamunā-pulināni ca
vīkṣyāsīd uttamā prītī

rāma-mādhavayor nṛpa

"O King Parīkṣit, when Rāma and Kṛṣṇa saw Vṛndāvana, Govardhana, and the banks of the river Yamunā,
They both enjoyed great pleasure."*

Lord Kṛṣṇa bravely faced the demon Ariṣṭāsura and rebuked the fleeing cowherd men, calling them cowards
(anivartī). Seeing that all the cowherd men had fled, He faced the demon alone (nivṛttātmā) and easily killed
him, grasping the demon's horns with His hand (saṅkṣeptā). In this way He returned the land of Vṛndāvana to
an auspicious condition (kṣema-kṛt). When the gopīs understood that Kṛṣṇa had killed a demon that had taken
the shape of a bull, they rejected His association, saying that He had become sinful by killing a bull. Kṛṣṇa
then called all sacred rivers to appear so He could bathe in them to become purified, and when they all
appeared at once, He bathed in them, and the gopīs became satisfied that Kṛṣṇa had returned to a pure and
auspicious condition (śiva). Lord Kṛṣṇa's chest is decorated with the mark of śrīvatsa (śrīvatsa-vakṣāḥ), and
He is very attached to His residence in the beautiful land of Vraja, at the foot of Govardhana Hill (śrīvāsa). He
protected the gopīs from the wrath of Indra (śrī-pati), and He is the best of all eloquent orators and the best of
the cowherd boys of Vraja (śrīmatāmbara).

śrīdaḥ śrīśaḥ śrīnivāsaḥ

śrīdharaḥ śrīkaraḥ śreyaḥ
śrīmān lokatrayāśrayaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa generously gives opulent gifts to His friends and relatives (śrīda), although He is also the
controller of all opulence, who prevents His devotees from attaining those material opulences that might
hinder their spiritual progress (śrīśa). He always resides in the land of Gokula, which is full of unparalleled
spiritual opulences (śrīnivāsa). All transcendental beauty and opulences are stored up within Him, just as
jewels are stored up in a sapphire-box (śrīnidhi). He manifests all beauty and opulence (śrīvibhāvana). He is
supremely handsome and He maintains the gopīs of Vraja and the goddesses of fortune (śrīdhara). All
spiritual opulences reside within His lotus-hand (śrīkara). He is very handsome and He always remains by the
side of śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, His internal pleasure potency (śreyaḥ). He is the master ofthe goddess of fortune
(śrīmān) and the shelter of Gokula Vṛndāvana, and all the three planetary systems as well (lokatrayāśraya).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains the name śrīmān by quoting from the Puruṣa-bodhinī Upaniśad:

dve pārśve candrāvalī rādhikety uktvā
yasyāṃśena lakṣmī-durgādikā-śaktiḥ

"Two gopīs, Candrāvali and Rādhārāṇī, always stay by Lord Kṛṣṇa's side. śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the original
form of the goddess of fortune, and she has expanded Lakṣmī-devī, Durgā, and the other goddesses of fortune
as her potencies."*

The Gautamīya Tantra also explains:

devī kṛṣṇamayī proktā

rādhikā para-devatā
sarva-lakṣmīmayī sarva-

kāntiḥ sammohinī parā

"The transcendental goddess śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the direct counterpart of Lord śrī Kṛṣṇa. She is the central
figure for all the goddesses of fortune. She possesses all the attractiveness to attract the all-attractive
Personality of Godhead. She is the primeval internal potency of the Lord."*

Lord Kṛṣṇa is supremely charming, handsome, and gentle (svakṣa), and his transcendental form is full of all
opulences (svaṅga). He delights the 108 gopīs (śatānanda), and He also relishes transcendental bliss by
enjoying pastimes in their association (nandi). Although He is the master of innumerable transcendental
devotees who try to please Him in various ways by holding an umbrella, fanning Him with a cāmara wisk, and
performing many similar services (jyotir-gaṅgeśvara), He remains humble and submissive to His devotees
(vijitātmā and vidheyātmā), and for this reason His transcendental good-character is eternally fomous
(satkīrti). He removes His devotee's doubts (chinna-saṃśaya).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains the name śatānanda by quoting from the Brahma-saṃhitā:

ciṇtāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpavṛkṣa-

lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam
lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṃ

"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows, yielding all desires, in
abodes built with spiritual gems, and surrounded by millions of purpose trees. He is always served with great
reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune."**

The name chinna-saṃśaya is described by Arjuna in the Bhagavad-gītā (6.39):

tvad-anyaḥ saṃśayasyāsya
chettā na by upapadyate

"O Kṛṣṇa, but for Yourself, no one is to be found who can destroy my doubt."*

Lord Kṛṣna's transcendental glories are chanted in all the Vedic literatures (udīrṇa), and He always
affectionately observes all His devotees (sarvataś-cakṣuḥ). He is completely submissive to His devotees
(anīśa), and He always remains with the devotees, never leaving their association (śāśvata sthira). He takes a
nap, resting in the transcendental forest of Vṛndāvana (bhūśaya), and He is nicely decorated with flowers and
other ornaments (bhūṣaṇa). He fulfills the desires of His devotees (bhūti), and when Akrūra was about to take
Him from Vṛndāvana to Mathurā, He tried to console the lamenting gopīs by vowing to quickly return to
Vṛndāvana (aśoka). By sending His messenger Uddhava to Vṛndāvana, He relieved the sufferings of His
father Nanda, His mother Yaśodā, and the other vrajavāīs (śoka-nāśana).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains the name bhūśaya by quoting from the śrīmad-Bhāgavatam
(10.15,16):

Lord Kṛṣṇa glowed with anger when He heard His father Vasudeva insulted by Kaṃsa (arciṣmān). He was
worshiped and honored by the florist Sudāmā and the girl Kubjā (arcita). Enchanted by Kṛṣṇa's
handsomeness, Kubjā wanted to enjoy Him as her paramour, and she lustily clutched the edge of His garments
(kumbha). When Kṛṣṇa promised to visit her home He was mnot trying to trick or fool her (viśuddhātmā). He
killed the elephant Kuvalayāpīḍa, purifying it of all sins and granting it liberation (viśodhana), and therefore
the elephant was unable to check Kṛṣṇa from entering the arena of Kaṃsa (aniruddha). Kṛṣṇa is always
victorious in fighting (apratiratha). Because His strength is unlimited, he easily defeated Cāṇūra and the other
wrestlers (pradyumna and amita-vikrama).

Lord Kṛṣṇa Killed the demon Kaṃsa, who in his previous birth as the demon Kālanemi was also killed by Him
(kālaneminihā). Displaying His prowess, Kṛṣṇa dragged the dead Kaṃsa in the wrestling arena (vīra). By
killing powerful Kaṃsa in this way, the son of Vasudeva (śauri) proved Himself the best of heroes
(śūrajaneśvara), and made the three planetary systems jubilant (trilokātmā). Lord Kṛṣṇa is the controller of all
the three worlds (trilokeśa). He has handsome black hair, and He is the father of Brahmā, śiva and all the
demigods (keśava). He killed the Keśī demon (keśihā), and thus delighted the minds of the cowherd residents
of Vṛndāvana, the demigods, and the other devotees (hari).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains the name vīra by quoting from the from the smṛti-śāstra:

harir yathebhaṃ vicakarṣa so 'vyayaḥ

"Lord Kṛṣṇa dragged Kaṃsa just as a lion drags an elephant after killing it."

The name trilokātmā may also be explained by quoting from from the smṛti-śāstra:

hate kaṃse trayo lokāḥ prāpnur anirvṛttiṃ parām

"The three planetary systems became delighted when the demon Kaṃsa was killed."

Lord Kṛṣṇa personally explains the meaning of the name keśava in the following quote from the from the
smṛti-śāstra:

sūryasya tapaso lokān
agneḥ somasya cāpy uta
aṃśavo ye prakāśante

"The sun-god, Sūrya, who shines on all the planets, the fire-god, Agni, and the moon-god, Soma, as well as all
the other demigods, who are all followers of Brahmā and śiva, are My parts and parcels and My children. For
this reason the great sages call Me Keśava (the father of Brahmā and śiva)."

After killing the Keśī demon, Kṛṣṇa was very splendid and handsome (kāmadeva), and by killing the demon
He satisfied all the desires of the residents of Vṛndāvana, and the demigods also (kāmapāla). By killing Keśī,
He delighted the demigods, although at that time the desire to kill Kaṃsa began to arise within His mind
(kāmikānta). After killing the demon, He returned to the village of Vrajabhūmi along with His friends
(kṛtāgama). It is not possible to describe His ultimate personal feature simply by dry philosophical speculation
devoid of bhakti (anirdeśya-vapuḥ), although that speculative method will easily enable one to understand His
feature as the impersonal effulgence that pervades the entire material cosmos (viṣṇu). He eloquently expounds
the perfect philosophy of spiritual life (vīra), and He remains always far away from those who are impure at
heart (ananta). After killing Kaṃsa, He took Kaṃsa's entire treasury and gave it to the pious king Ugrasena
(dhanañjaya).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes an explanation of the name viṣṇu, given in the śrīmad-Bhāgavatam
by the Lord Himself:

vyāptā me rodasi pārtha

brahmaṇyo brahma-kṛd brahmā
brahma brahma-vivardhanaḥ
brahma-vid brahmaṇo brāhmī
brahmajño brāhmaṇa-priyaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the benefactor and well-wisher of Gargamuni and the entire community of brāhmaṇas, and He
devotedly engages in their service (brahmaṇya). He personally engages in the austerities and spiritual
practicies enjoined for the brāhmaṇas (brahma-kṛt), and He is also the origin of those spiritual duties
(brahmā). Lord Kṛṣṇa is the unlimited Supreme Brahman, full of all transcendental qualities, the maintainer
of all living entites, and the Absolute Truth knowable by the study of Vedānta philosophy and hidden from the
view of the atheists (brahma). He encourages the brāhmaṇas in their practice of austerity for the attainment of
spiritual perfection (brahma-vivardhana), and he Himself was initiated by Gargamuni, and thus set the
example of how to understand the Supreme Brahman by chanting the Gāyatrī-mantra (brahma-vit). He
appeared many times, as Lord Dattātreya, and in many other forms, to preach the spiritual philosophy of the
Vedas (brāhmaṇa), and He is the supreme controller of the entire cosmic manifestation (brāhmī). He learned
the nature of the Absolute Truth by studying under His spiritual master Sāndīpani Muni (brahmajña). He
greatly pleased His guru and became very dear to him by returning his dead sons (brāhmaṇa-priya).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the following definition of the name brahma, found in the Vedic
dictionary, the Nirukti:

yato brahma samaṣṭi-vyaṣṭi-bhūtān puruṣān bṛṃhayati svayaṃ ca niḥśimātiśaya-svarūpa-guṇa-vibhūtibhir
bṛṃhati ca

"The word brahma means He who nourishes and maintains (bṛṃhayati) the living entities, and who Himself
possesses unlimited (bṛṃhati) and ever-increasing transcendental forms, qualities, opulences and potencies."

The same explanation is given by Lord śiva in the smṛti-śāstra:

bṛṃhatvād bṛṃhanatvāc ca
tasmād brahmeti-śabditaḥ

"Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unlimited (bṛṃha), and because He maintains and nourishes
all living entities (bṛṃhana), therefore, He is known as `brahma'".

The name brahma-vit is explained in the śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: (10.45.29):

gargād yadu-kulācāryād
gāyatrīṃ vratam āsthitau

"Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma accepted Gargamuni, the ācārya of the Yadu dynasty, as their spiritual master, and He
initiated them in the chanting of the Gāyatrī mantra."*

The name brahma-vivardhana describes The Lord as increasing the austerities of the brāhmaṇas. In this
connection śrīla Bhaktivinoda ṭhākura quotes the Vedic explanation of the actual nature of austerity:

tapaḥ śrī-hari-kīrtanam

"Austerity means to glorify Lord Hari."

mahākramo mahākarmā
mahātejo mahoragaḥ
mahākratur mahāyajvā
mahāyajño mahāhaviḥ

By kicking the sleeping King Mucukunda, Lord Kṛṣṇa cleverly killed the demon Kālayavana (mahākrama).
Kṛṣṇa's transcendental activities, such as the killing of Kālayavana, are glorious, praiseworthy, worshipable
and wonderful (mahākarmā), and His transcendental strength remains always undefeated (mahātejaḥ). He
remains always situated within the hearts of His pure devotees, such as King Mucukunda, although He
sometimes also blesses those devotees by stepping out of the heart and appearing before them (mahoraga). If
one offers a tulasī leaf with sincere devotion to Lord Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, that activity is the greatest worship, far
better than performing numberless Vedic rituals, for Kṛṣṇa becomes controlled by the devotees who worship
Him in this way (mahākratu). Lord Kṛṣṇa's devotees are the best of all performers of sacrifice (mahāyajvā),
He personally prefers the chanting of His holy names as the best of sacrifices (mahāyajña), and as far as
oblations to be offered in sacrifice, He considers the offering of obeisances by bowing down with devotion to
be the best of all oblations (mahāhavi).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes King Mucukunda's prayers to explain the name mahātejaḥ (Bhāg.
10.51.28)

kiṃsvit tejasvināṃ tejo
bhagavān vā vibhāvasuḥ

"My dear Lord, are You not therefore, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the most powerful
amongst the powerful? Are You not the original source of all illumination and fire?"*

The name mahoraga describes the Lord's love for His devotees, and His personal association with them faceto-
face. This is described in the following quote from the smṛti-śāstra:

yato rāmatvenāvatāre niṣāda-rājaṃ guham āliṅgya jaṭāyuśa ūrdhva-daihikaṃ karma cakāra. śabari-gṛhe taddattāni
phalāny ati-prītyā bubhuje.

"When the Lord appeared as Rāmacandra there was a great exchange of love between the Lord and His
devotees. The Lord personally embraced His devotee Guha, the king of the Niṣādas, and He personally
performed the funeral ceremony of the great devotee Jaṭāyu. When He visited the house of śabari He ate with
great relish the simple offering of forest-fruits presented before Him. In these ways the Lord appeared before
His devotees, and showed His love for them."

The name mahākratu is explained in the Viṣṇu-dharma:

ulasī-dala-mātreṇa

jalasya culukena ca
vikrīṇite svam ātmānaṃ

bhaktebhyo bhakta-vatsalaḥ

"śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is very affectionate to His devotees, sells Himself to a devotee who offers merely a tulasī leaf
and a palmful of water."

The name mahāyajña is explained in the following way in the Mokṣa-dharma:

yāḥ kriyāḥ saṃprayuktāḥ syur

ekānta-gata-buddhibhiḥ
tāḥ sarvāḥ śirasā devaḥ

pratigṛhṇāti vai svayam

"If, with undeviating concentration, one chants the holy names of the Lord and performs similar devotional
activites, then Lord Kṛṣṇa becomes greatly pleased. He respectfully accepts such services and places them
upon His head."

japyenaiva ca saṃśuddhyed

brāhmaṇo nātra saṃśayaḥ
kuryād anyān na vā kuryān

maitro brāhmaṇa ucyate

"A brāhmaṇa or Vaiṣṇava should chant the holy names of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and in this way become purified of all
material contamination. One who enthusiastically accepts this process of chanting Lord Kṛṣṇa's names, and
rejects the fruitive rituals enjoined in the Vedas, is the best of all brāhmaṇas."

This is also explained in the śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (12.3.51):

kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya
mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṃ vrajet

"Simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, one can become so pure that one becomes free from all the
contamination of the material world, and goes back home, back to Godhead."*

The name mahāhavi is explained in the Vedic literatures:

kṛṣṇa-praṇāmī na punar-bhavāya

"One who offers obeisances by bowing down before Lord Kṛṣṇa becomes free from the entanglement of
repeated birth and death."

Text 86

stavyaḥ stava-priyaḥ stotraṃ
stutiḥ stotā raṇa-priyaḥ
pūrṇaḥ pūrayitā puṇyaḥ
puṇya-kīrtir anāmayaḥ

Because Lord Kṛṣṇa possesses unlimited auspicious transcendental qualities, He should be continually
glorified with eloquent prayers (stavya). He becomes greatly pleased when devotees sincerely describe His
glories and chant His holy names (stava-priya). He personally empowers His devotees, such as Dhruva and
others, to speak eloquent prayers (stotram), and they continually glorify His transcendental pastimes and
qualities (stuti). He is inclined to praise the good qualities of His devotees (stotā). He relishes fighting that
gives Him an opportunity to kill a demon (raṇa-priya), and because He possesses all strength He can kill an
unlimited number of demons single-handedly (pūrṇa). His devotees also sometimes kill the demons in this
world (purāyitā), and Lord Kṛṣṇa also purifies the universe by killing the atheists (puṇya). The chanting of His
glories purifies all living entities (puṇya-kīrti), and that glorification of Him acts as a medicine to cure the
disease of repeated birth and death (anāmayam).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the Vedic literature to explain the name stotā:

vandito hi sa vandeta
mānito mānayīta ca

"The devotees are eager to worship and glorify Lord Kṛṣṇa, and the Lord is inclined to worship and glorify
them."

Text 87

manojavas tīrthakaro
vasuretā vasupradaḥ
vasuprado vāsudevo
vasur vasumanā haviḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa quickly rescues the surrendered devotees from the distresses of repeated birth and death
(manojava), and He speaks the Bhagavad-gītā and other Vedic literatures to teachthe living entities how to
attain Him (tīrthakara). He is the father of the cosmic manifestation (vasuretāḥ), He protects the eight vasus,
and He gives all opulences to His devotees (vasuprada). He is personally present when there is discussion of
the actual truth of spiritual life (vāsudeva), and He always remains in His eternal spiritual abode (vasu). Very
satisfied with His devotee Bhīṣma, He always remembers him (vasumanā), and when Bhīṣma called out for
Him, Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared (havi).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes Lord śiva's explanation of the name vāsudeva:

vasanād eva vāde ca

vāsudeveti-śabditaḥ

"The name vāsudeva means: He who resides in the proper discussion of spiritual truth."

The name vasumanā is described in the following quote:

śara-talpo gato bhīṣmaḥ

śāmyan nibahutāsanaḥ
māṃ dhyāyati puruṣa-vyāghra

tato me tad-gataṃ manaḥ

"Greatly afflicted, and lying on the bed of arrows, Bhīṣmadeva remembered Me at the last stage of his life.
Because of his rememberance of Me, O best of men, I now always remember him."

sadgatiḥ satkṛtiḥ sattā
sadbūtiḥ sat-parāyaṇaḥ
śūraseno yadu-śreṣṭhaḥ
san-nivāsaḥ suyāmunaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa is attained only by Bhīśmadeva and other pure devotees (sadgati). Out of friendship for His
devotees, He helps them at the time of death (satkṛti), and He is very eager to visit His devotees, such as the
Pāṇḍavas and the residents of Vrajabhūmi (sattā). Full of love for his devotees (sat-parāyaṇa), He is willing to
become their messenger or gate-keeper, as He did for Yudhiṣṭhira, Ugrasena and Mahārāja Bali (sadbhūti).
He is the leader of the powerful Yādava army(śūrasena), and He is the most exalted person in the Yadu
dynasty (yadu-śreṣṭha). He resides in the splendid city of Dvārakā and other spiritual abodes (san-nivāsa). He
is splendidly handsome as He enjoys pastimes in the forest of Bṛhadvana near the bank of the Yamunā
(suyāmuna).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the Varāha Purāṇa to explain the name satkṛti:

yadi vātādi-dośeṇa

mad-bhakto māṃ na ca smaret
ahaṃ smarāmi mad-bhaktaṃ

nayāmi paramāṃ gatim

"If My devotee is not able to remember Me at the time of death because of the great disturbances felt within
the body at that time, then I shall remember My devotee and take him back to the spiritual world."

The name sattā may be described by quoting the words of the residents of Dvārakā in śrīmad-Bhāgavatam
(1.11.9):

arhy ambujakṣāpasasāra bho bhavān
kurūn madhūn vātha suhṛd-didṛkṣayā

"O lotus-eyed Lord, You are very eager to go away to Mathurā, Vṛndāvana of Hastināpura to meet Your
friends and relatives."

The name sat-parāyaṇa may be described by quoting the following verse from śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (9.4.68),
where the Lord says:

sādhavo hṛdayaṃ mahyaṃ
sādhūnāṃ hṛdayaṃ tv aham

mad-anyat te na jānanti
nāhaṃ tebhyo manāg api

"The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart, and I am always in the heart of the pure devotee. My
devotees do not know anything else but me and I do not know anything else but them."*

bhūtavāso vāsudevaḥ
sarvāsu-nilayo 'nalaḥ
darpahā darpado 'dṛpto
durdharo 'thāparājitaḥ

All material elements and the entire cosmic manifestation rest within Lord Kṛṣṇa, who appears before His
devotees' eyes and upon their lotus-hearts (bhūtavāsa). Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoys pastimes with the members of the
Yadu dynasty (vāsudeva), and He is their life-breath (sarvāsu-nilaya). Kṛṣṇa fulfills all the desires of the
Pāṇḍavas and Yadus (anala). Kṛṣṇa crushes to powder the false pride of the conditioned souls, as He strikingly
did to Duryodhana during the rājasūya-yajña (darpahā). Kṛṣṇa gives all honor to His devotees, as He
strikingly did to Yudhiṣṭhira during the rājasūya-yajña (darpada). Although Kṛṣṇa's powers and activities are
extraordinary and unprecedented, He remains very humble and free from pride (adṛpta). He was unsucessful
when sent as the Pāṇḍavas' messenger to dissuade ill-advised Duryodhana, who was intent on depriving the
Pāṇḍavas of their claim to the throne, (durdhara). No one can defeat Him, and the Kurus became crushed
when they tried to defeat Him (aparājita).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes Lord śiva's explanation of the name bhūtavāsa:

vasanti tvayi bhūtāni
bhūtavāsas tato bhavān

"O Lord, because all material elements and the entire cosmic manifestation reside within You, You are
therefore known as `bhūtavāsa'."

The name anala may also be interpreted in the following ways: 1. Kṛṣṇa is very willing to forgive the offenses
committed by His devotees 2. Kṛṣṇa is like a fire that destroys those enimical to His devotees 3. Kṛṣṇa places
His devotees in positions of authority 4. Kṛṣṇa gives the living entities the facility to become His devotees.

To explain the name durdhara, the following verse may be quoted

imaṃ hi pundarīkākṣaṃ

jighṛkṣanty alpa-medhasaḥ
paṭhenāgni-prajvalantaṃ

yathā bālā yathā jaḍāḥ

"The members of the Kuru dynasty were defective in the matter of possessing intelligence, and when they read
the letter Pāṇḍavas' letter, they burned with anger. In this condition they became so much like little children,
and so much like fools, that they desired to seize the messenger Kṛṣṇa, and make Him their captive in
retaliation."

viśva-mūrtir mahā-mūrtir
dīpta-mūrtir amūrtimān
aneka-mūrtir avyaktaḥ
śata-mūrtiḥ śatānanaḥ

The entire universe, consisting of all the demigods, Gandharvas, human beings, demons, and all living entities,
is one of Lord Kṛṣṇa's forms (viśva-mūrti). Nothing can compare with Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental form
(mahā-mūrti). His form is more splendid and effulgent than numberless blazing fires (dīpta-mūrti). Except for
the universal form, all of Lord Kṛṣṇa's forms are spiritual and eternal, and not made of material elements
(amūrtimān). He appears in many forms simultaneously, as He did by expanding into 16,108 forms to please
the queens at Dvārakā (aneka-mūrti). When Nārada saw that Kṛṣṇa had expanded into 16,108 forms and was
enjoying many different pastimes simultaneously, the sage became bewildered (avyakta). Kṛṣṇa appears in
hundreds of forms, which are all like auspicious nectar (śata-mūrti). His handsome face is as sweet as nectar
(śatānana).

Note: To explain the name avyakta, śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes from the śrīmad-Bhāgavatam
(10.69.2):

citraṃ bataitad ekena

vapuṣā yugapat pṛthak
gṛheṣu dvy-aṣṭa-sāhasraṃ

striya eka udāvahat

"It is astounding that Lord śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is one without a second, expanded Himself in sixteen thousand
similar forms to marry sixteen thousand queens in their respective homes."*

Text 91

eko naikaḥ savaḥ kaḥ kiṃ
yat-tat-padam anuttamam
loka-bandhur loka-nātho
mādhavo bhakta-vatsalaḥ

Although to enjoy His pastimes Lord Kṛṣṇa appears in many viṣṇu-tattva forms (naika), He remains one
person (eka). He is always different from the individual living entities (sava), and He is splendid and effulgent
(ka). He is the supreme goal of the quest for knowledge (kim) and the supreme shelter of all living entities
(yat-tat-padam anuttamam). He strongly binds the devotees with the rope of pure love He bears for them
(loka-bandhu), and He is the master of all living entities (loka-nātha). By speaking the Bhagavad-gītā He
removed the conditioned souls' illusions (mādhava). He always desires His devotees' welfare (bhakta-vatsala).

Note: To explain the name kim, śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the śruti-mantra:

sa vijijñāsitavyaḥ

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of the quest for knowledge."

To explain the name loka-nātha, the Svetāśvatara Upaniśad (6.7) says:

tam īśvarāṇāṃ paramāṃ maheśvaraṃ
tam devatānāṃ paramaṃ ca daivatam

"The Supreme Lord is the controller of all other controllers, and He is the greatest of all the diverse planetary
leaders."*

suvarṇa-varṇo hemāṅgo
varāṅgaś candanāṅgadī
vīrahā viṣamaḥ śūnyo
dhṛtaśīr acalaś calaḥ

Lord Kṛṣṇa appears as śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and in His early pastimes He appears as a householder with
a golden complexion (suvarṇa-varṇa and hemāṅga). His limbs are beautiful (varāṅga), and His body, smeared
with the pulp of sandalwood, seems like molten gold (candanāṅgadī). Lord Kṛṣṇa kills lust, greed, and all
other enemies of His devotees (vīraḥā). No one is equal to or greater than Lord Kṛṣṇa, who protects the
devotees and kills the demons (viṣama). Lord Kṛṣṇa is free from all material defects, and He made the entire
world inauspicious for the demons and atheists (śūnya). He grants all auspiciousness to His devotees
(dhṛtāśīḥ). He was unmoving in His determination to protect the Pāṇḍavas from all dangers (acala). In order
to keep the promise of His devotee Bhīṣma, He broke His own promise not to take up any weapon in the
Kurukṣetra war (cala).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa asserts that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
according to the evidence of the Upaniṣads. He explains that suvarṇa-varṇa means a golden complexion. He
also quotes the Vedic injunction:

yadā paśya paśyate rukma-varṇaṃ
kartāram īśam puruśaṃ brahma-yonim

"Rukma-varṇaṃ kartāram īśam"refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead as having a complexion the
color of molten gold. Puruṣam means the Supreme Lord, and brahma-yonim indicates that He is also the
Supreme Brahman. This evidence proves that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.
Another meaning of the description of the Lord as having a golden hue is that Lord Caitanya's personality is
as fascinating as gold is attractive. śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa has explained that the word varāṅga means
"exquisitely beautiful".

śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains the name viṣama by quoting from the Svetāśvatara Upaniśad:

na tat samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate

"No one is equal to or greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

The name śūnya is defined in the following verse from the from the smṛti-śāstra:

śamūnāṃ kurute viṣṇur

adṛśyaḥ san paraḥ svayam
tasmāc chūnya iti proktas

todanāt tuccha ucyate

"Remaining invisible, Lord Viṣṇu imperceptively removes all auspiciousness from the demons, and therefore
He is known as śūnya."

(The first part of this verse and footnote, the part describing Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is taken from His
Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda's translation of śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Adi-līlā,
Chapter 3, verse 49.)

amānī mānado mānyo
loka-svāmī triloka-dhṛk
sumedhā medhajo dhanyaḥ
satya-medhā dharādharaḥ

Although He is the controller of everything, and although He makes His devotees successful, Lord Kṛṣṇa
remains very humble at heart (amānī), and desires to give all credit and honor to His devotees (mānada). He
crushes they who become His devotees' enemies (mānya). He is the controller of all the universes (loka-svāmī)
and the maintainer and protector of the three planetary systems (triloka-dhṛk). Although He is the master of
everything, and although He is the most intelligent of persons, He becomes controlled by His pure devotees,
meditates on their good qualities, and aspires to attain their association (sumedhāḥ). In order to attain their
association, He appears amongst the devotees (medhaja). He considers Himself wealthy when He has attained
the association of pure devotees who consider Him their only wealth (dhanya). Not destroyed when the
universe is annihilated, Lord Kṛṣṇa exists externally, although the cowherd people of Vṛndāvana, unaware
that He is the Supreme, think of Him as their son, friend, or relative, (satya-medhāḥ). He lifted Govardhana
Hill (dharādhara).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains the name dhanya by quoting from the śrīmad-Bhāgavatam
(1.8.27):

namo 'kiñcana-vittāya

"O Lord Kṛṣṇa, my obeisances are unto You, who are the property of the materially impoverished."*

Seeing His extraordinary powers, the residents of Vṛndāvana thought Kṛṣṇa might be the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Kṛṣṇa then spoke to them the following words, which illustrate the name satya-medhah__:

yadi vo 'sti mayi prītiḥ

ślāghyo 'haṃ bhavatāṃ yadi
tad ātma-bandhu-sadṛśī

buddhir vaḥ kriyatāṃ mayi

"My dear friends, if you have any love for me, or if You think I am glorious or praiseworthy, then please know
it that I am your friend and relative. I am not a demigod or Gandharva descended to this earth, and neither am
I a Yakṣa or a demon with mystic powers. I am simply your relative, born in your family and community.
Please do not think of Me in any other way."

He protected His friends, the cowherd people of Vraja, from Indra's devestating rainfall (tejo-vṛṣa), and as He
protected them, He was handsome and splendid (dyuti-dhara). He killed Jarāsandha, śalva, and many other
demons wielding dangerous weapons (sarva-śastra-bhṛtāmbara). Out of friendship He accepted the role of
Arjuna's chariot-driver (pragraha). By glancing on Arjuna's enemies He ordained their destruction (nigraha),
which was quickly accomplished (vyagra). He used many strategies to defeat the Pāṇḍava's enemies (naikaśṛṅga).
He is also the elder brother of Gada (gadāgraja).

caturmūrtiś caturbāhuś
caturvyūhaś caturgatiḥ
caturātmā caturbhāvaś
caturveda-vid ekapāt

Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared as Nara, Nārāyaṇa, Hari, and Kṛṣṇa, who were the four sons of Dharma (caturmūrti).
Bhīma, Arjuna, Satyaki, and Uddhava were like His four arms (caturbāhu). He is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead described in the four Vedas (caturvyūha). Four kinds of faithful persons: the distressed, those in
need of money, the curious, and those inquisitive to know the absolute truth, surrender unto Kṛṣṇa (caturgati).
Lord Kṛṣṇa grants economic development, piety, sense-gratification and liberation to the living entities in
general (caturātmā) and the devotees in particular (caturbhāva). He teaches the actual message of the Vedas
to the devotees (caturveda-vit). The countless material universes are a tiny fragment of His actual opulence
and power (eka-pāt).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains that the name caturgati may also be interpreted to mean: 1. Lord
Kṛṣṇa enjoys pastimes in four transcendental abodes: Goloka Vṛndāvana, Gokula Vṛndāvana, Mathurā, and
Navadvīpa, or 2. Lord Kṛṣṇa's walking may be compared to the strides of a lion, tiger, elephant, or bull.

The name eka-pāt is described in the puruṣa-sūkta prayers:

pado 'sya viśva bhūtāni

"The material world is only a small part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's opulence."

samāvartto nivrttātmā

durlabho durgamo durgo
durāvāso durārihā

Lord Kṛṣṇa repeatedly creates (samāvartta) and destroys (nivṛttātmā) the material universes. He is
invincible and is only defeated by pure devotional service (durjaya). No one can ignore His order
(duratikrama). He is attained only by the most difficult to practice pure devotional service (durlabha). He is

understood by the difficult path of studying the Upaniṣads and Vedānta (durgama), and He is glorified by the
hymns of the Sāma Veda, which difficult to sing (durga). When one follows the difficult path of completely
surrendering to Him, He becomes willing to reside in one's heart (durāvāsa). Although to serve Him is
difficult, He helps the devotees by crushing their formidable enemies, who have lust as their general
(durārihā).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the explanation of the name nivṛttātmā found in the smṛti-śāstra:

millions of devotees are maintained (yogī), He is the mster of the four Kumaras, and all other yogīs, and He
grants the spiritual attainments for which they aspire (yogīśa). To those who take up the pat of yogī, but later
fall down because of materialism, He grants residence in the upper planetary systems, where the fallen yotīs
can enjoy the sense-gratification for which they aspired (sarvakāmada). After enjoying for some time on the
heavenly planets, such fallen yotīs take birth in family of devotees who follwo the varṇāśrama system and in
this way, Lord Kṛṣṇa gives these yogis a chance to make further advancement in spiritual life (āśrama), Lord
Kṛṣṇa arranges that such fallen yogīs become again attracted to the principles of spiritual life (śramaṇa). Lord

the wind (vāyuvāhana).

"The unsuccessful yogī, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born
into a family of righteous people, or into a family of rich aristocracy. Or he takes his birth in a family of
transcendentalists who are surely great in wisdom."

When Rukmi and His army tried to defeat Kṛṣṇa , they became spectacularly unsuccessful (aparājita). Lord
Kṛṣṇa tolerantly excused all the blasphemous insults spoken by His brother-in-Law Rukmī (sarvasaha),
although He soon retaliated by binding Rukmī with ropes, and humiliating him by partly shaving his head,
leaving some patches of hair here and there (niyantā). Lord Kṛṣṇa defeated Jambavān (niyama), and thus won
both Jambavatī and the Syamantaka gem (yama).

tie the bowstring very easily, just as a child plays with a toy. He placed the arrow, and looking only once at the
reflection of the fish in the water, He shot the arrow, and the pierced fish immediatly fell down. This victory of
Lord Kṛṣṇa was accomplished at noon, during the moment called aghijit, which is astronomically calculated as

showers them with innumerable benedictions, and He even gives Himself to His devotee to become the

aupsiciousness from the atheists and non-devotees (svastikṛt). He is the supreme auspiciousness (svasti), He
protects the auspicious condition of the devotees who continuyally remember Him, and He Himself enjoys the
greates auspiciousness as He performs transcendental pastimes in the spiritual worls (svastibhuk). he gives
entrance into His spiritual realm, and well as many other aupicious gifts to those who become the performers
of the Vedic sacrifice which is His devotional service (svastidakṣiṇa).

araudrah kuṇḍalī cakrī
vikramy ūrjita-śāṣanaḥ
śabdātigaḥ śabdasahaḥ
śiśiraḥ śarvarīkaraḥ

Because Lord Kṛṣṇa is always full of transcendental bliss, He never becomes angry, but is always, gentle and
beneficent (araudra). He is decorated with shark-shaped earrings, a crown, necklaces, and many other
ornaments (kuṇḍalī). He is the general of a limitless army which can never be defeated (cakrī), and his
immeasurable strength can destroy any number of the most powerful demons (vikramī). Brahmā, śiva and all

the demigods never transgress His orders (ūrjita-śāsana), and neither the thousand-headed Lord Anantadeva,
nor Sarasvatī-devī, the goddess of learning, can fully describe His unlimited glories (śabdātiga). Lord Kṛṣṇa
felt compassionate upon the Pāṇḍavas when He heard Draupadī's appeal for protection from the possibe
wrath of Durvāsā (sābdasaha). He protected the Pāṇḍavas from repeated calamity (śiśira), and by taking in
His hand a little vegetabe from Draupadī's pot, He mercifully protected the Pāṇḍavas (śarvarīkara).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the explanation of the name araudra found in the from the smṛtiśāstra:

aroṣaṇo hy asau devaḥ

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is very gentle, and not inclined to become angry or violent."

akrūraḥ peśalo dakṣo
dakṣiṇaḥ kṣamiṇāmbaraḥ

Because Lord Kṛṣṇa is always very much inclined towards the brāhmaṇas, he did not violently stop Durvāsā
from the possible harm He would have committed to the Pāṇḍavas, (akrūra). He expertly protected the
Pāṇḍavas by allaying the hunger of Durvāsā and his disciples (peśala), and He immediately apeared before
Draupadī as soon as He heard her appeal for protection (dakṣa). He expertly thwarted all the attempts of
Duryodhana (dakṣiṇa), and He mercifullly forgave Durvāsā from the offense he was about to commit towards
the Pāṇḍavas (kṣamiṇāmbara). He expertly protected the surrendered devotee Gajendra from an impending
catastrophe (vidvattama), and He removed all of Gajendra's fears (vītabhaya). Simply by hearing and chanting
His glories, Gajendra and many others also, became free from all sins (puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtana).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the description of the name vītabhaya found in the from the smṛtiśāstra:

Lord Kṛṣṇa rescued Gajendra by lifting him out of the lake where he was trapped by the crocodile (uttāraṇa),
and he killed the crocodile to protect His devotee (duśkṛtihā), He purifies all who hear the account of
Gajendra's deliverance (puṇya), and He rescues from bad dreams those who remember the story of Gajendra
(duḥśvapa-nāṣana). He killed the powerful crocodile (vīrahā), and by touching Gajendra delivered Him from
the imprisonment in the body of an elephant (rakṣaṇa). In this way He granted auspiciousness to Gajendra
(santa). and He also brought the Gandharva Hūhū back to life, freeing him from the body of a crocodile which
had been imposed upon him by the curse of Devala Muni (jīvana). After hearing Gajendra's prayers, the Lord
became greatly pleased and full of love for His devotee (paryavasthita). Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa

"O best of the Bhāratas, what mantra should one chant, or whom should one meditate upon and remember to
become free from bad dreams?"

Lord Nārāyaṇa answered this question in the following words:

ye māṃ tvāṃ ca saraś caiva

anantarūpo 'nantaśrīr
jitamanyur bhayāpahaḥ
caturasro gabhīrātmā-
vidiśo vyādiśo' diśaḥ

When Brahmā stole the calves and cowherd boys, Lord Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself into innumerable forms just
like those of the stolen calves and boys. (anantarūpa), and thus manifested His unlimited power and opulence
(anantaśrīḥ). Even though Brahma tried to create mischief by stealing Kṛṣṇa's associates, magnanimous Kṛṣṇa
did not become angry with him (jitamanyu), and when frightened Brahmā begged for forgiveness, Lord Kṛṣṇa
removed all his fears (bhayāpaha). When Lord Kṛṣṇa expanded into many forms to replace His stolen friends,
He immediately accepted each of the elderly gopīs as His mother (caturasra), Lord Kṛṣṇa's thoughts and
intentions are so unlimitedly profound and inscrutable, that even Lord Brahmā, after offering prayers and
apologies, could not unerstand whether Kṛṣṇa had accepted his apologies, or remained dissatisfied with him
(gabhīrātmā). Because Brahma had interrupted Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with His friends, Kṛṣṇa became displeased
with him and asked him to leave the area of Gokula, so the activities of Vrajabhūmi could continue
undisturbed (avidiśa). On many different occasions Lord Kṛṣṇa entrusted Brahmā with various responsibilities
in the management of the universe, and gave him specific instructions in this regard (vyādiśa). Because Lord
Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and ultimate controller if everything, He does not have to
follow anyone's order (adiśa). Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the explanation of the name
anantarupa found in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.13.19):

yāvad vatsaka-vatsapālaka-vapur yāvat karāṅghry-ādikaṃ

yāvad yaṣṭi-viśāṇa-veṇu-dala-śṛg yāvad vibhūśāmbaram
yāvac chīla-guṇa-guṇābhidha-kṛti-vayo yāvad vihārādikaṃ

sarvaṃ viṣṇumayaṃ giroṅgavad ajaḥ sarva-svarūpo babau

"By His Vāsudeva feature, Kṛṣṇa simultaneously expanded Himself into the exact number of missing cowherd
boys and calves, with their exact bodily features, their particular types of hands, legs and other limbs, their
sticks, bugles, and flutes, their lunch bags, their particular types of dress and ornaments, placed in various
ways, their names, ages and forms, and their special activities and characteristics. By expanding Himself in this
way, beautiful Kṛṣṇa proved the statement samagraṃ jagad viṣṇumayam: Lord Viṣṇu is all-pervading."

The name adiśa is described in the Svetāśvatara Upaniśad (6.7):

tam iśvarāṇāṃ paramaṃ maheśvaraṃ

tam devatānāṃ paramaṃ ca daivatam
patiṃ patīnāṃ paramaṃ parastād

vidāma devaṃ bhuvaneśam īḍyam

"The Supreme Lord is the controller of all other controllers, and he is the greatest of all the diverse planetary
leaders. Everyone is under His control. All entities are delegated with particular power only by the Supreme
Lord: they are not supreme themselves. He is also worshippable by all the demigods and is the supreme
director of all directors. therefore, He is transcendental to all kinds of material leaders and controllers, and is
worshipable by all. there is no one greater than Him, and He is the supreme cause of all causes."

The Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.2.21) further explains:

svayaṃ tv asāmyātiśayas tryadhīśaḥ

svarājya-lakṣmyāpta-samasta-kāmaḥ
baliṃ haradbhiś cira-lokapālaiḥ

kirīṭa-koṭīḍita-pāda-pīṭhaḥ

"Lord śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Lord of all kinds of threes, and is independantly supreme by acheivement of all kinds of
fortune. He is worshiped by the eternal maintainers of the creation, who offer Him the paraphernalia of
worship by touching their millions of helmets to His feet."

Lord Kṛṣṇa is independent, and He does not need to follow the instructions of Brahmā or anyone else (anādi).
He was merciful to Brahmā and forgave his offenses (bhūḥ), and He was the transcendental ornament which
decorated the land of Vrajabhūmi (bhuvo-lakṣmīḥ). He is a great hero, and fully competant to wrestle with
śrīdāma and the other cowherd boys as their equal (suvīra), and he also embraced His friends with His
splendid transcendental arms (rucirāṅgada). In the company of Lord Balarāma and the gopīs, He performed
the springtime rasa-dance near the slope of Govardhana Hill (janana). He is free from the material defects of
birth, death, old-age and disease (ajana-janmādi). He appeared very ferocius and terrifying to śaṅkhacūḍa
who committed an offense to the gopīs (bhīma), and leaving Lord Balarāma to protect the gopīs powerful
Kṛṣṇa chased śaṅkhacūḍa, caught him, killed him and took away the syamantaka jewel he wore in his crown
(bhīma-parākrama).

Note: śrila Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa explains that although Kṛṣṇa is never actually born as a condition soul is,
He appears within this world in His original transcendental form, and appears to be born as an ordinary
human being, although He is always free fromthe cycle of repeated birth and death. This is confirmed in the
Vedas:

eko devo nitya-līlānurakto
bhakta-vyāpī bhakta-hṛdy antarātmā

"The one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many, transcendental forms in
relationships with His unalloyed devotees."

Lord Kṛṣna also explains in the Bhagavad-gītā (4. ):

janma karma ca me divyam

"My birth and activities are all transcendental."

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the shelter of the gopīs who are very beautiful, gentle, charming, expert in singing, dancing and
speaking clever words, and full of all good qualities, and Lord Kṛṣṇa by playing His flute, attracted these gopis
to Vrndavana forest to perform the rāsa-dance on the full-moon night of the śara-season (ādhāranilaya).
Alone with the gopīs in the forest, Lord Kṛṣṇa caused them to drink the nectar of His charming clever words,
His sweet, gentle smiles, and His sidelong glances (dhātā). Joking with the gopīs, Lord Kṛṣṇa's smile appeared
as charming as a flower (puśpahāsa). Lord Kṛṣṇa stayed awake for an entire night of Brahmā, performing His
pastime of dancing with the gopīs (prajāgara). Performing the rāsa pastime with the beautiful and wonderfully
qualified gopīs, Lord Kṛṣṇa was so splendidly handsome that He appeared to be chastising cupid as an
incompetent buffoon (ūrdhvaga). The gopīs love Him with pure hearts, completely free from any material
motive (satpathācāra). Lord Kṛṣṇa is the life of all living entities, and He tried to reward the gopīs (who had
given up everything for His sake), by giving everything, even Himself, to them (prāṇada). In this way He
demonstrated that pure unalloyed love for Him is the most valuable and praiseworthy quality that anyone can
attain (praṇava). In this way, Krṣṇa, who knows the actual value of everything, gave the greatest value to the
gopīs' pure love for Him (praṇa).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the explanation of the name puspahasa found in the Srimad-
Bhagavatam (10.29.43):

udāra-hāsa-dvija-kunda-dīdhiti
vyarocataināṅka ivoḍubhir vṛtaḥ

"Lord Kṛṣṇa smiled and His teeth appeared as beautiful as white kunda flowers. In the midst of the gopīs,
He appeared just like the full moon surrounded by millions of shining stars."

The name prajāgara is also explained in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.33.38):

brahma-rātra upāvṛttaḥ

"During the rāsa-dance, the night turned into the night of Brahmā, lasting for millions of years."

The Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.32.14) explains the name urdhvaga inthe following way:

cakāsa gopī-pariśad-gato 'rcitas
trailokya-lakṣmyaika-padaṃ vapur dadhat

"When Lord Kṛṣṇa finally reappeared and assembled with the gopīs, He looked very beautiful, just befitting a
person with all kinds of opulences. "

The names describing the gopīs pure love of Kṛṣṇa are described in the Lord's own words to the gopīs (Srimad
Bhagavatam 10.32.22):

na pāraye 'haṃ niravadya-samyujāṃ

sva-sādhu-kṛtyaṃ vibudhāyuśāpi vaḥ
yā mābhajan durjara-geha-śṛṅkhalāḥ

samvṛścya tad vaḥ pratiyātu sādhunā

"O gopīs, your relationship with Me is completely transcendental, and it is not possible for Me to offer
anything in exchange for your love, even after many births. You have been able to give up all attachment for
material enjoyment, and you have searched after Me. Since I am unable to repay your love, you have to be
pleased with your own activities."

By speaking to the gopīs in this way, Lord Kṛṣṇa proved that pure unalloyed love for Him is the supreme goal
of life (pramāṇam), Immersed in the nectar of pure love of Kṛṣna, the gopis appeared to merge into Him,
although they kept their seperate identities, just as a bird enters its nest, and appears to disappear within it,
although the bird actually keeps its individuality all along (prāṇa-nilaya). By giving the gopīs the nectar of
blissful personal exhange with Him, Kṛṣṇa maintained their lives (prāṇabhṛt). The gopīs considered Kṛṣṇa
more dear than life (prāṇa-jīvanam). Kṛṣṇa's dealings with the pastimes with the gopīs were not all material,
but completely on the spiritual platform (tattvam). He continually relishes such spiritual exchanges (tattvavit),
and He is the only Supreme Personality of Godhead (ekātmā), completely beyond the birth, death, old-age,
disease, hunger, thirst, and other defects of material existance (janma-mṛtyu-jarātiga).

of the three planetary systems. He provides the ingredients which the devotees use for His worship (yajña),
and He is the protector of the process of devotional service (yajñapati). He forbids the living entities to follow
the so-called spiritual paths proposed by so many cheaters and speculators, and advises them to take up His

Sāma Veda chant His glories (sāma-gāyan). He appeared as the son of Devakī, and He also became the son of
Yaśodā (devakīnandana). He protected Devakī and Yaśodā from all dangers (sraṣṭā), and He destroyed the
demoniac kings, who had become a great burden for the earth (kṣitīśa). He removes the sins of those who take
to hearing and chanting His pastimes and glories, and He also removes the sins of those demons who are
fortunate enough to be killed by Him, and granted liberation (pāpa-nāṣana).

Note: śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa quotes the explanation of the names svayamjata and vaikhāna, found in
the Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.2.15):

sva-śānta-rūpeśv itaraiḥ sva-rūpair

"The Personality of Godhead, the all-compassionate controller of both the spiritual and material creations, is
unborn, but when there is friction between the peaceful devotees and persons who are in the material modes
of nature, He takes birth just like fire, accompanied by the mahat-tattva."

That devakīnandana can also mean "the son of Yaśodā"is described in the following quote from the Purāṇas:

dev nāmnī nanda-bharyāyāṃ yaśodā devakī

"Nanda Mahārāja's wife is known by two names: Yaśodā and Devakī."

Lord Kṛṣṇa's appearance as the son of Devakī is described in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.3.8):

niśīthe tama udbhūte
jāyamāne janardane
devakyāṃ deva-rūpiṇyāṃ
viṣṇuḥ sarva-guhā-śayaḥ

"Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, who is seated in the core of everyone's heart, appeared
from the heart of Devakī in the dense darkness of night, like the full moon rising on the eastern horizon,
because Devakī was of the same category as śrī Kṛṣṇa."

Yaśodā was unable to understand the kṛṣṇa had been substituted for daughter, Yogamāyā. This is described in
the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.3.53):

of Lord Krsna's holy name:

"The holy name of Lord Krsna is the most auspicious of all auspicious things, and the sweetest of all sweet
things. It is completely spiritual, withoug any touch of matter, and it is the transcendental fruit of the creeper
of all the Vedic literatures. If one chants the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, even once, either with faith, or even in
the spirit of mocking Him, the holy name will deliver the chanter from the bondage of material existance."

The sincere chanter of the holy name may sometimes commit offenses in the course of his chanting. the
remedial measure to become free from such offenses is described in the Padma Purana:

gīte nāmāparadheśu

pramadena kathañcana
sadāsaṅkīrtayan nāma

tad-ekaśaraṇo bhavet

"If one may sometimes, because of foolishness or immaturity, commit offenses to the holy name, then the
remedy for such offenses is t continue one's regular chanting of the holy name, and take shelter of Him with all
earnestness."

nāmāparādha-yuktānāṃ

nāmāny eva haranty agham
aviśrānti-prayuktāni

tāny evārtha-karāṇi ca

"If one becomes determined, and continues his chanting of the holy name, and does not give up the process of
chanting, the holy name will remove all his sins, and grant to him, the most valuable spiritual benefit.

About the Translator

Peter Viggiani, an accomplished Sanskrit and Bengali scholar, is an initiated disciple of His Divine
Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder/Acharya of the International Society for Krishna
Consciousness. Peter took the spiritual name “Kusakratha dasa” in 1971 spending many years thereafter

constantly studying the ancient Vedic scriptures of India, learning the Sanskrit and Bengali languages the
literatures are written in. Even before coming to Krsna Consciousness, Peter had been voracious reader of
philosophy, studying the Bhagavad-gita and other spiritual literatures even as a young boy.

His spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada, had translated and published between the years of 1965 and 1977, the
most important Vedic texts, namely Bhagavad-gita, Bhagavata-Purana, Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Chaitanya-
Caritamrta, and many others establishing the “Bhaktivedanta Book Trust” for their distribution.

Srila Prabhupada on several occasions expressed his intention to translate all the Vaisnava writings for
the benefit of mankind, and it is to the credit of Kusakratha dasa, in service to his spiritual master, that he has
so far translated dozens of these ancient spiritual texts set down by the chief Vedic scholars and spiritual
leaders of India’s past. We are most indebted to Kusakratha das for his prodigious output, he has rendered a
great service to all devotees of God through his sublime Krsna Bhakti.

His Divine Grace A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada

Founder/Acarya of the International Society for Krsna Consciousness

Srila Prabhupada appeared in Calcutta, India in 1896. Meeting his own spiritual master His Divine
Grace Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in 1922 he took formal initiation in 1933. At the very first meeting, Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge in the English language.

In the years that followed Srila Prabhupada took up that desire, writing a commentary on Bhagavadgita
and founding a fortnightly magazine, “Back to Godhead”, in 1944. Actively endeavoring to teach Krsna
Consciousness while in household life, Srila Prabhupada retired in 1954 to devote more time to his studies and
spiritual master’s service. Residing in the holy city of Vrndavana for some 11 years, he formally took to the
renounced order of life, sannyasa, in 1959. Constantly pursuing his spiritual masters request to broadcast the
Vedic knowledge, Srila Prabhupada began planning a world-wide movement, and started the translation
work of his life’s opus, Srimad Bhagavatam, revered in the Vedas as the essence of all Vedic knowledge.

Srila Prabhupada struggled against many obstacles, and in 1965 left India for America, carrying very
little money, the first three volumes of Srimad-Bhagavatam he had published, and the order of his spiritual
master in his heart. The rest is history. Within eleven years, up to 1977, a world-wide movement dedicated to
exemplifying and broadcasting the Vedic spiritual knowledge sprouted up, comprising over 200 temples in fifty
countries, a dozen farming communities, and several publishing houses and schools.

Srila Prabhupada initiated some 5,000 disciples, circled the globe fourteen times, and spoke with
countless world leaders, all the while continuing to translate the Vedic texts into English just exactly in
pursuance of his spiritual master’s original instruction way back in 1926.

The spiritual society Srila Prabhupada founded goes on to this day having distributed over 500 million
literatures in 50 languages, blooming into a world-wide movement known for its purity, dedication, and
international welfare activities of food distribution.

These writings comprise a veritable library of Vedic philosophy, religion, and culture and the reader is
heartily encouraged to please examine these literatures, they are a meant to offer a clue for the respiritualization
of the entire human society, which although having made rapid material progress, seems to be
so much disturbed with unwanted quarrels and discord.
