# MYWebScrappings
Some ipython notebooks that I use for scrapping the web.

Right now this is my attempts to understand the workings of beaustifulsoup through the notebook interface.

For the Ramayana files, I use the files from http://readramayana.org/out/Vaalmeeki-BaalaKaanda-Sargas-1-77-Devanagari-WM.html, http://readramayana.org/out/Vaalmeeki-AyodhyaKaanda-Sargas-1-119-Devanagari-WM.html, and http://readramayana.org/out/Vaalmeeki-AranyaKaanda-Sargas-1-75-Devanagari-WM.html. 

For the vishnu sahasranamam, I use the files from Wikipedia and the files from http://swami-krishnananda.org/vishnu/
